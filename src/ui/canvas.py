# tuning (SPEC-gaze-cursor-redesign.md S10) -- a single-colour ring cannot be,
# and the first attempt proved it: a dark-green core on the forest theme's
# light-green background, among dark-green grid outlines drawn in the same
# `cursor_color`, was reported as blending in and hard to notice.
#
# Copying Gazepoint Control's *colour* was the error there. Their saturated
# green works because their backdrop is near-black; the transferable principle
# is maximum contrast against the background, not the hue itself.
# The dark fringe is the load-bearing half, and it was chosen by measurement,
# not taste: rendered against the real forest scene, a white halo round a
# theme-coloured core scored 32205 against the plain ring's 30832 -- a 4%
# improvement, because white fringe on a near-white background adds almost no
# ink. Dark fringe with a white core scored 53363, +73%. The core then carries

        Returns ``None`` when there is nothing to draw at all -- only before
        the very first on-canvas reading of a run, when no position has ever
        been established to freeze at.

        **Off-canvas gaze freezes the cursor in place** rather than tracking it
        to the nearest edge (SPEC-gaze-cursor-redesign.md S10, revising S4.2).
        The earlier design clamped to the edge and faded by distance; the user
        asked for parity with Gazepoint Control instead, where looking away
        simply stops the marker. That makes "looking away" and "tracking lost"
        visually identical, which is a deliberate, accepted consequence --
        Gazepoint Control does not distinguish them either, and it removes the
        distance threshold this otherwise needed.

        Hit-testing is untouched by any of this. ``BaseTask`` still sees the
        true, unfrozen, possibly out-of-range position, so freezing can never
        cause a selection the child did not actually make -- freezing is the
        renderer's decision alone (the same separation S6 of
        SPEC-gui-audit-2026-09-10.md established for the clamp).
