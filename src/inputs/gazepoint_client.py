"""Gazepoint OpenGaze API client (TCP) + offline replay source.

The GP3HD's *Gazepoint Control* application exposes a TCP server (default
``127.0.0.1:4242``) that speaks a small XML protocol. Clients send
``<SET ID="ENABLE_SEND_..." STATE="1" />`` records to subscribe to data fields,
then receive a stream of ``<REC ... />`` records — one per gaze sample.

This module provides:

* :func:`parse_rec` — parse a ``<REC .../>`` line into an attribute dict.
* :func:`rec_to_sample` — convert that dict into a normalized :class:`GazeSample`.
* :class:`ReplayGazeSource` — deterministic, thread-free playback of a
  ``.jsonl`` fixture, used by the headless pipeline and unit tests.
* :class:`GazepointClient` — the live TCP client (plan section 5.1). It can also
  drive a *paced* replay when no hardware is attached, so the full GUI can be
  developed with no tracker present.

All output coordinates are normalized (0-1); pixel conversion is the canvas's
responsibility.
