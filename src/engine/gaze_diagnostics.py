"""Gaze dropout / off-canvas excursion diagnostic (SPEC-gaze-cursor-redesign.md S6).

Built to answer questions the source alone cannot: how often the tracker
actually drops out during a real task, how long a dropout lasts, and how far
off the canvas real gaze travels. The off-canvas fade threshold (S4.2) is meant
to be set from this data rather than guessed -- the precedent is
``SPEC-gui-audit-2026-09-10.md`` S9, where a constant was guessed, implemented,
live-tested and still wrong, and only measurement produced the right value.

Deliberately mirrors ``src/engine/calibration.py``'s timing diagnostic: one
shared append-only JSONL under ``sessions/_system/diagnostics/``, across every run and
subject, with every filesystem error swallowed. A diagnostic must never be able
to break a session a child is sitting through.
