"""Gazepoint calibration flow (plan section 5.4 / risk table).

Wraps the OpenGaze calibration commands. The real calibration UI is rendered
by Gazepoint Control; here we trigger it and poll ``CALIBRATE_RESULT_SUMMARY``
for the resulting per-point error so it can be stored in ``metadata.json`` for
data-quality filtering. Without hardware the class runs in a no-op stub mode.

Calibration is asynchronous on the device: ``CALIBRATE_START``'s ACK only
confirms the command was received, not that calibration finished (the child
still has to look at each animated point in turn). The result must be polled
for after starting it (API manual §3.7). This also means :meth:`run` must be
called while nothing else is reading the socket -- otherwise the background
reader thread's ``recv()`` races with this class's own ``recv()`` for the same
bytes and can silently swallow the calibration response. :meth:`run` therefore
pauses an already-streaming client's reader for its whole socket use
(SPEC-calibration-result-timeout.md S4.1) and resumes it afterwards.
