"""Gaze-to-feedback latency measurement (plan risk table / gap F).

Measures the delay between a gaze sample arriving from the tracker (its
capture timestamp, ``GazeSample.t_ns``, stamped when the reader thread parses
the ``<REC>`` line) and this frame's processing (``clock.now_ns()`` in
``_tick()``), as a proxy for end-to-end "gaze -> screen feedback" latency.
This is the pipeline latency from socket arrival to the app consuming it; it
does not include the final GPU/compositor time to actually present the
repainted frame, which this app has no way to measure without OS-level
display instrumentation.

Only meaningful for a live tracker connection: a replay source's timestamps
are relative to its own virtual clock, not the in-run clock, so a difference against
``clock.now_ns()`` would be meaningless (see ``GazepointClient.is_live``).
