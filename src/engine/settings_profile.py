"""Saved per-subject, per-task settings profiles.

SPEC-live-settings-panel.md S10. A physician tunes a task to a child during a
throwaway first run; those values must survive into the data-collection runs
that follow, and be recoverable when the same child returns another day.

Keyed **per subject and per task** rather than globally, mirroring the
calibration precedent (``sessions/_calibrations/<subject_id>/``): one child's
tuning silently becoming the next child's starting point is a protocol hazard,
not a convenience.

Every save is its own file (S10.12): ``<subject>/<task_id>/<local date>_<local
time>.json``. Nothing is ever overwritten, so a profile saved on one day is
still there to choose after a different one is saved the next. The pre-S10.12
flat ``<subject>/<task_id>.json`` is read as one more version and never
rewritten. Timestamps are **local** time with their UTC offset -- the date is
the label an operator picks a version by, and a UTC date is the wrong day for
any save before 08:00 in this lab's timezone (S10.12.2).

Kept Qt-free so it can be unit tested headlessly, and deliberately tolerant in
the same way as :mod:`src.engine.local_state`: a missing, empty or malformed
profile is treated as "no profile", never as an error. A saved profile is a
convenience, so a corrupt one must degrade to config defaults rather than
block a session.
