# Clinical Data Reference

Cross-reference for every field this app saves: what it means, exactly which
Gazepoint OpenGaze API call/attribute it comes from, and why it's relevant
(or not yet used) for assessing Cerebral Palsy (CP) and similar neuro
conditions. Companion to [`DATA_SCHEMA.md`](DATA_SCHEMA.md) (full schema,
no clinical framing) and [`gazepoint_api_cheatsheet.md`](gazepoint_api_cheatsheet.md)
(raw API mechanics, no clinical framing) — this doc exists so a future
session doesn't have to re-derive both at once.

Originally compiled 2026-09-02 while triaging physician feedback; see
`docs/specs/SPEC-2026-09-02.md` in the top-level project (not this repo) for
the full triage context this was extracted from.

## Run folder layout

One folder per recorded run, inside that child's own folder
(`docs/DATA_SCHEMA.md` has the whole per-subject tree):

```
sessions/P001/runs/click_static/2026-07-15_1432/
  metadata.json      # subject + session + calibration + schema_version
  session.log        # human-readable timeline
  gaze_stream.csv    # per-frame gaze samples
  trials.csv         # one row per trial (analysis-ready)
  events.jsonl        # discrete events (TARGET_SHOWN, HIT, TIMEOUT, MISS_CLICK)
```

All timestamps are **nanoseconds** (`time.time_ns()` domain). Coordinates are
**normalized** (0–1, origin top-left) unless the field name ends in `_px`.

## gaze_stream.csv — per-frame raw gaze

The most clinically dense file: everything here originates directly from a
single Gazepoint `<REC .../>` record.

| Field | OpenGaze API source | Meaning | Clinical relevance for CP / neuro assessment |
|---|---|---|---|
| `t_ns` | (client receive time, not a REC attribute) | Capture timestamp | Needed to derive latency/duration metrics below; not itself clinical. |
| `x`, `y` | `BPOGX`/`BPOGY` (fallback `FPOGX`/`FPOGY` if best-POG invalid) — enabled by `ENABLE_SEND_POG_BEST` / `ENABLE_SEND_POG_FIX` | Normalized point of gaze | Raw gaze position; the input to every derived spatial/accuracy metric (hit rate, gaze heatmap). On its own mainly a QA signal — see `valid` below for how much of it can be trusted. |
| `valid` | `BPOGV` (or `FPOGV` on fallback) | Whether the tracker considers this sample valid | Proportion of invalid samples ("off-screen proportion") is itself one of the features found to reliably distinguish CVI/CP-related visual impairment from typical development (see Sources). Not currently aggregated by this app (see "Unused" section below). |
| `fixation_id` | `FPOGID` — enabled by `ENABLE_SEND_POG_FIX` | Increments once per new fixation | Lets you count **fixation frequency** and segment the stream into discrete fixations — a core input to CP/CVI oculomotor classification. Not currently aggregated. |
| `fix_duration_s` | `FPOGD` | Duration of the current fixation so far, seconds | **Fixation duration** — one of the most-used eye-tracking metrics in developmental/cognitive research generally, and specifically one of the features with AUC ≥0.90 distinguishing CVI/CP children from controls in the 2025 study cited below. Not currently aggregated. |
| `pupil_left`, `pupil_right` | `LPMM`/`RPMM` — enabled by `ENABLE_SEND_PUPILMM` (see API note below) | Pupil diameter, millimeters | Used in the literature mainly as a cognitive-load / attention / arousal signal rather than a CP-specific oculomotor marker — secondary priority unless the clinical goal explicitly includes engagement/attention tracking. Not currently aggregated. |

**API note (corrected 2026-09-02):** pupil diameter is gated by
`ENABLE_SEND_PUPILMM` (OpenGaze manual §5.16), **not**
`ENABLE_SEND_PUPIL_LEFT`/`ENABLE_SEND_PUPIL_RIGHT` — those instead gate the
*pixel*-based `LPD`/`RPD` fields (§5.9/5.10), which this app does not read.
`gazepoint_api_cheatsheet.md` previously stated this incorrectly; both are
now fixed (see [[peds-eye-gaze-assessment-pupilmm-fix]] equivalent in the
top-level project memory for the original bug this was caught by).

## trials.csv — one row per completed trial

Derived/aggregated from the raw gaze stream plus task logic, not read
directly from a REC record.

| Field | Derivation | Meaning | Clinical relevance |
|---|---|---|---|
| `trial_id`, `task_id` | app-generated | Trial index, task name | Bookkeeping. |
| `target_x`, `target_y`, `target_radius_px` | app-generated (task config) | Where/how big the target was | Needed to interpret accuracy; not itself a subject measurement. |
| `t_target_shown_ns` | app event timestamp | Target onset | Baseline for every latency metric below. |
| `t_first_gaze_on_target_ns` | first frame where `(x,y)` (from `BPOGX/Y`/`FPOGX/Y`) entered the target hitbox | First-fixation time | Input to `time_to_first_fixation_ms` below — a direct analogue of **saccade/fixation latency**, one of the CVI/CP-classifying features cited below. |
| `t_click_ns` | first frame dwell selection triggers | Selection time | Input to `reaction_time_ms`. |
| `t_end_ns` | app event timestamp | Trial end (hit or timeout) | Bookkeeping. |
| `is_hit`, `is_timeout` | app logic | Outcome flags | **Selection accuracy** — matches the accuracy metric used in a published longitudinal study of gaze-based AT performance in children with CP (Compass software; see Sources) — this app's `click_grid` task is explicitly modeled on that same software. |
| `attempts` | app logic (counts off-target selections too) | Selection attempts this trial | A rough proxy for gaze-control precision/impulsivity — not validated against literature here, but directly analogous to "false selection" counts used in AAC-access research. |
| `reaction_time_ms` | `t_click_ns − t_target_shown_ns` | Time to complete selection | **Reaction time** / **time-on-task** — the other half of the Compass-study accuracy metric above. |
| `time_to_first_fixation_ms` | `t_first_gaze_on_target_ns − t_target_shown_ns` | Time to first look at target | Closest analogue in this app's data to **saccade latency**, one of six oculomotor features reaching AUC ≥0.90 in classifying CVI (common in CP) vs. typically-developing children in the 2025 study below. |

## metadata.json — session-level

| Field | Source | Meaning | Clinical relevance |
|---|---|---|---|
| `calibration_error_px` | Gazepoint `CALIBRATE_RESULT_SUMMARY` (`<GET ID="CALIBRATE_RESULT_SUMMARY" />`), mean across calibration points | Mean calibration accuracy | Not just a QA metric: a 2025 CP-specific study found 6 of 39 children *could not calibrate to the required accuracy at all* — calibration success/quality is itself a data point about a child's oculomotor control, worth tracking per-subject over time. |
| `calibration_points` | app config (`calibration.points`, 5 or 9) | Calibration density used | Context for interpreting `calibration_error_px` across sessions/subjects. |
| `input_mode`, `gazepoint_model`, `subject_id`, `session_id`, `schema_version`, `tasks`, `notes` | app-generated | Bookkeeping | Not clinical data. |

## events.jsonl

Raw event log (`TARGET_SHOWN`, `HIT`, `TIMEOUT`, `MISS_CLICK`, `LATENCY_SAMPLE`)
that `trials.csv` is derived from — useful for re-deriving custom metrics
later, but not a distinct clinical data source beyond what's summarized above.

## Fields recorded and now aggregated (updated 2026-09-03)

`analysis/analyze_session.py` computes hit rate, timeout count, mean
reaction time, a reaction-time histogram, and a 2D gaze heatmap — **and, as
of 2026-09-03, also**:

- Fixation count and rate/min (`fixation_id`)
- Fixation duration mean/median/max (`fix_duration_s`)
- Saccade count and rate/min (derived from fixation-id transitions)
- Valid-gaze ratio, i.e. tracked vs. off-screen/invalid proportion (`valid`)
- Mean pupil diameter, left/right (`pupil_left`/`pupil_right`)
- Distinct fixation count per trial (single-target-fixation vs.
  target-target-fixation-shift signal)

via `src/data/exporter.py::compute_fixation_saccade_metrics` and
`compute_trial_fixation_counts`, written to a new `session_metrics.json` in
the session directory alongside the existing outputs. See
`docs/specs/SPEC-2026-09-02.md` item 6 for the implementation writeup and
[[peds-eye-gaze-assessment-physician-feedback-2026-09-02]] for the memory
pointer.

**Still not done** (candidate for future work, not implemented here): the
off-screen-proportion / saccade-latency features from the AUC≥0.90 CVI
classifier study aren't separately broken out (fixation/saccade *rate* is,
but not latency specifically), and there's no formal CVI-classification-style
report or dashboard built on top of this raw aggregation layer yet.

## Gazepoint Analysis's own session-level summary — is it API-accessible?

**No.** "Gazepoint API" refers to two different things and it's easy to
conflate them:

- **The OpenGaze API** (port 4242, served by Gazepoint Control) — a
  **live, real-time per-sample data stream**. This is the one this app
  already integrates against. It does **not** carry session summaries or
  AOI statistics, and it doesn't even carry saccade magnitude/direction —
  `SACCADE_MAG`/`SACCADE_DIR` are explicitly CSV-export-only fields with
  no API stream equivalent (confirmed in our own vendor-corpus synthesis,
  `docs/gazepoints/synthesis/data-fields-reference.md` in the top-level
  project).
- **Gazepoint Analysis** (the separate desktop GUI app bundled with the
  tracker) — this is where session-level summaries actually get computed:
  AOI statistics (viewed/not, time-to-first-view, time viewed %, revisits,
  revisitors, clicks, plus per-AOI biometric averages). But per its own
  manual (`docs/gazepoints/sources/gazepoint-analysis.md`, current and a
  2014 edition both checked), the **only** way this data leaves the app is
  a manual GUI action — pressing **Export** writes
  `{RECORDING}_all_gaze.csv`, `{RECORDING}_fixations.csv`, and
  `Data_Summary_export_{DATETIME}.csv` to a `\result\` folder. No CLI flag,
  scripting hook, or batch-automation mode is documented anywhere for
  triggering or reading that export programmatically.
- External corroboration: a 2026 peer-reviewed R package, `gp3tools`
  (Balaskas 2026, *J Eye Movement Research*), exists specifically to parse
  Gazepoint Analysis's *manually exported* CSV files — its own
  documentation notes this is a workaround because there's no live API for
  the summary data, and that metrics it recomputes from the raw exports
  "may not always exactly reproduce Gazepoint's internal calculations."

**Practical implication:** this app already bypasses Gazepoint Analysis
entirely (it talks to Gazepoint Control's live API directly), so any
session-level summary metrics wanted here — including saccade
amplitude/direction — have to be computed by this app's own analysis layer
from `gaze_stream.csv`, not pulled from Gazepoint Analysis.

### Session-level metrics worth designing toward (external research)

| Category | Metric | Why it matters for CP/neuro assessment | Already recorded? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Data quality | % valid/on-screen samples, calibration error | A 2025 CP study found 6/39 children couldn't calibrate to the required accuracy at all — a clinical signal, not just QC. A toddler eye-tracking battery study (eLife 2023) uses accuracy + precision as its two general per-session data-quality proxies. | `valid`, `calibration_error_px` — **aggregated 2026-09-03** (`valid_ratio` in `session_metrics.json`; calibration error was already in `metadata.json`) |
| Fixation | Mean/median fixation duration, fixation count/rate | One of six features reaching AUC ≥0.90 classifying CVI (common in CP) vs. controls (2025 study, cited above in this doc). | `fixation_id`, `fix_duration_s` — **aggregated 2026-09-03** (session-level mean/median/max duration, count, rate/min; plus a new per-trial fixation count not in the original design-toward list) |
| Saccade | Latency (≈ time-to-first-fixation), amplitude, direction | Same 2025 study. Amplitude/direction are exactly the two fields Gazepoint doesn't expose live (see above) — computed in-house from consecutive fixation POGs, exactly as Gazepoint Analysis does at export. | Latency: yes (`time_to_first_fixation_ms`, per-trial). Saccade **count/rate aggregated 2026-09-03**. **Amplitude/direction: DONE 2026-09-17** — per-saccade in `fixations.csv` (`SACCADE_MAG` px, `SACCADE_DIR` deg), session mean/median px + mean degrees of visual angle + circular-mean direction in `session_metrics.json` `saccades` (SPEC-gazepoint-analysis-export-parity.md). A distinct latency-per-saccade metric still isn't broken out |
| Task performance | Hit rate / accuracy %, mean reaction time, time-on-task | Matches the metrics used in the published Compass-based longitudinal CP study `click_grid` is modeled on. | Yes, already computed by `analysis/analyze_session.py` |
| Selection precision | Revisit / re-attempt counts | A 2026 CP oculomotor-training study (ScienceDirect, *Acta Psychologica*) tracked "fixation precision and visual exploration" pre/post intervention using gaze-driven games; this app's `attempts` field is a rough analogue. | Yes (`attempts`), not yet framed as a precision metric |
| Pupil | Mean/trend pupil diameter | Secondary priority — literature treats it mainly as an attention/cognitive-load signal, not CP-specific. | **Aggregated 2026-09-03** — mean pupil L/R mm in `session_metrics.json`; trend-over-time still not computed |

### Sample export analysed (2026-09-17) — what Analysis actually produces vs. what we record

The planned step above was done against a real Gazepoint Analysis v7.3.0
export (`resources/gazepoint-analysis-example-data/` in the top-level
project). Full findings and the resulting plan:
`docs/specs/SPEC-gazepoint-analysis-export-parity.md`. The short version:

- **The export is the same `<REC>` stream this app already consumes** —
  `_all_gaze.csv` is 62 columns of raw API attributes plus ~6 columns
  Analysis computes at export; `_fixations.csv` is the same columns filtered
  to each fixation's last valid sample; `Data_Summary` is AOI statistics
  (empty unless AOIs were drawn in Analysis).
- **We keep 6 of the 62 columns** (`gaze_stream.csv`, with FPOG/BPOG folded
  into one `x,y`). A further ~30 are either already received and discarded
  (`TIME`, `FPOGS`, `LPMMV/RPMMV`, `CX/CY/CS`) or one `ENABLE_SEND_*` flag
  away (`CNT`, `TIMETICK`, `KB/KBS`, `USER`, pixel pupil `LPD/RPD` +
  centre/scale, blinks `BKID/BKDUR/BKPMIN`, `PIXS/PIXV`). The biometrics
  columns need the Biometrics kit and are excluded by decision.
- **The API-less columns are derivable after all.** `SACCADE_MAG` /
  `SACCADE_DIR` were reverse-engineered from the sample: pixel distance and
  `atan2` angle between consecutive fixation POGs, reproduced to 0.0002 px /
  0.00004° over every saccade once the recording's screen size (3440×1440)
  is known. This turns the "needs genuinely new tracking" entries for
  saccade amplitude/direction in the table below into an offline derivation
  from `gaze_stream.csv` — **provided the session's screen size is persisted,
  which `metadata.json` does not do today.** AOI "time viewed / revisits"
  remain genuinely new tracking.
- **Implemented the same day** (SPEC §9): every session now also writes
  `all_gaze.csv` (62-column Analysis layout, every raw `<REC>` at device
  rate) and `fixations.csv`, `metadata.json` carries the monitor / canvas /
  physical / viewing-distance geometry, `session_metrics.json` has a
  `saccades` block (amplitude px + degrees, circular-mean direction), and
  the Results page's saccade amplitude/direction rows are filled. The
  derivation is golden-tested against the vendor's own export. The table
  below is updated accordingly.
