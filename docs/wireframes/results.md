> **Design note:** reached by clicking **Analyze** on a completed task card in Tasks (`tasks.md`) — also a persistent top-level tab like Setup/Tasks, so it's reachable directly too. Always shows the **most recent run** for whichever task was last analyzed (re-runs stay on disk in their own `_run1`/`_run2`/... session folders, but only the latest is shown here in this phase — no run-picker yet). Modeled closely on `resources/images/diki-ui-3.png`'s table structure, restyled into this project's own WTMH Clinical Teal theme.

### Static Click — 32 trials

Computed alongside the raw `trials.csv`/`gaze_stream.csv`/`events.jsonl` and written to `session_metrics.json` in this run's session folder.

> **"—" means not yet computed by this codebase** (see the metrics-category gap report in `docs/specs/SPEC-result-logic.md`) — not a rendering bug. Rows already backed by real data today: Valid samples, Calibration error, Fixation mean/median duration, Fixation rate, Hit rate.
> **Alternate state (not shown above):** if Valid samples fell below an 80% floor, a warning banner would appear directly under the Data quality table — `::: alert warning` — "! valid share 62% below the 80% floor" (wording/threshold matches the reference image; exact floor value TBD at implementation time).
