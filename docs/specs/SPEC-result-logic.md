# SPEC-result-logic — Result Logic (session metrics, results screen, calibration data)

**Status:** §1-§9 are all implemented, unit-tested, and live-validated.
§8's redesign (calibration details inline section, the dedicated "3 ·
Results" tab, the 4-category metric layout) is now **built, not just
designed** — see §9. §3's original auto-shown-after-every-run Results page
has been reverted/replaced by §8's flow exactly as specified. A real,
previously-undocumented bug was also found and fixed this round (§9): the
Session Log panel's data source, `session.log`, was silently empty for
every normal run before this fix — see §9's "real bug" note before trusting
this doc's own earlier §8.3 claim that it needed no new capture.
**Committed and pushed to `origin/main` as `9d6e8d3`** — nothing from this
SPEC remains uncommitted.
**Created:** 2026-09-09
**Last updated:** 2026-09-09

## 1. Origin / what was asked

Session objective, stated as: "The main objective on this session would be
relevant to Result logic." Investigation (before any code was written) found
that every task run already writes raw `trials.csv`/`gaze_stream.csv`/
`events.jsonl`/`metadata.json` (`src/data/recorder.py`), but the rolled-up
result (hit rate, mean reaction time, fixation/saccade/pupil aggregates,
already implemented in `src/data/exporter.py`) was only ever computed if
someone manually ran `analysis/analyze_session.py <session_dir>` afterward —
neither the GUI nor disk ever showed a result automatically right after a run.

Four items were scoped with the user (via clarifying questions):

1. Auto-generate `session_metrics.json` on every run (live GUI + headless
   `--replay`), instead of requiring the manual script.
2. Show a results screen in the GUI after a task run finishes, before
   returning to the Tasks dashboard.
3. Result-scoring logic (hit/miss/timeout) — flagged only; the user had no
   concrete change in mind, so `src/tasks/base_task.py` was explicitly left
   untouched this session.
4. A research question, not a build request: does a metric already exist
   (from Gazepoint's own API) describing a single calibration point-count's
   result (accuracy/error)? This surfaced `CALIB_RESULT`, a per-point/per-eye
   record the API already pushes that the code was silently discarding — the
   user asked to capture it now (cheap plumbing) even though the actual
   n-point comparison/tradeoff logic is explicitly deferred to later, after
   real n-point data collection with a cooperative subject.

## 2. Part 1 — auto-generated `session_metrics.json`

**New function**, `src/data/exporter.py::write_session_metrics(session_dir)`:
combines the three functions that already existed (`summarize()`,
`compute_fixation_saccade_metrics()`, `compute_trial_fixation_counts()`) into
the same `{"summary", "fixation_saccade", "fixations_per_trial"}` shape
`analysis/analyze_session.py` used to build inline, and writes it to
`session_metrics.json`.

- `analysis/analyze_session.py` now calls `write_session_metrics()` instead of
  duplicating the `json.dumps`/`write_text` — no behavior change to the
  script's own output.
- `src/app.py::AssessmentApp._shutdown()` calls it right after
  `self.recorder.close()`, so every live GUI run auto-produces the file.
- `src/engine/task_runner.py::run_headless_replay()` now explicitly calls
  `recorder.close()` right after `write_trials()` (idempotent — guarded by
  `SessionRecorder._closed`), then `write_session_metrics()`, and returns a
  new `"session_metrics_path"` key.
- No new dependency on either path — the three reused functions are stdlib
  `csv`/`json`/`statistics` only (`pandas` stays a lazy import elsewhere).

**Test:** `tests/test_task_pipeline.py::test_headless_replay_auto_writes_session_metrics`
asserts the file exists after a headless replay and its contents match
`summarize()`/`compute_fixation_saccade_metrics()` computed independently.

## 3. Part 2 — GUI results screen

**New file**, `src/ui/results_page.py` — `ResultsPage(QWidget)`. Follows
`TaskSettingsDialog`'s existing card pattern (`QFrame#wtmhCard` +
`QGraphicsDropShadowEffect`), reusing `wtmh_theme.py`'s existing
`wtmhPageTitle`/`wtmhSectionTitle`/`wtmhMuted`/`wtmhPrimary` object names — no
new CSS. Shows task/subject/session header, a "Summary" block (trials, hits,
hit rate, timeouts, mean reaction time — from `exporter.summarize()`), and a
"Gaze quality" block (valid gaze ratio, fixations, fixation duration
mean/median/max, saccades, pupil L/R mean — from
`exporter.compute_fixation_saccade_metrics()`), plus a "Continue" button
(`continue_requested` signal). Both exporter calls already degrade to
`None`/zero on an empty session rather than raising, so `populate()` needed no
extra guarding — `None` renders as "—".

**`src/ui/dashboard_window.py` changes:**
- `self.results_page = ResultsPage()` added to `self.stack` at construction
  (`_RESULTS_INDEX = 2`; the dynamically-appended embedded task view's index
  shifted from 2 to 3, `_RUN_INDEX = 3`).
- `_on_task_finished` split in two: it now captures
  `assessment.recorder.session_dir` before tearing down the view, calls
  `self.results_page.populate(...)`, and shows the Results page — instead of
  jumping straight back to Tasks. The former tail of `_on_task_finished`
  (mark task "Complete", re-enable nav/run buttons, switch to Tasks) moved
  into a new `_on_results_continue()`, wired to the Results page's
  `continue_requested` signal.
- **Bug this split would otherwise introduce, fixed in the same change:**
  `_go_to_tab`'s guard only checked `self._active_assessment is not None`.
  Since `_on_task_finished` sets that to `None` before showing the Results
  page, an operator clicking the top "Setup"/"Tasks" nav buttons while
  Results was showing would bypass `_on_results_continue` entirely, leaving
  Tasks' run buttons and the Setup nav button permanently disabled (their
  re-enable now only happens in `_on_results_continue`). Fixed with a new
  `self._viewing_results` flag, set/cleared alongside the page switch, and
  added to `_go_to_tab`'s guard: `if self._active_assessment is not None or
  self._viewing_results: return`.

## 4. Part 3 — result-scoring logic (hit/miss/timeout)

No code change. `src/tasks/base_task.py`'s trial state machine (hit =
on-target selection while `selectable`; anything else clicked is a
miss/attempt; no response by `timeout_ns` is a timeout) is exactly as it was
before this session. Flagged here only, per the user's own explicit answer
("nothing concrete yet — flag it, don't change it").

## 5. Part 4 — capture Gazepoint's `CALIB_RESULT` (per-point/per-eye)

**Research finding** (`docs/gazepoints/sources/gazepoint-api.md` §4.3): the
OpenGaze API pushes a `CALIB_RESULT` record once, unprompted, at the end of
calibration — per point *i*: target (`CALXi`/`CALYi`), left-eye estimate +
validity (`LXi`/`LYi`/`LVi`), right-eye estimate + validity
(`RXi`/`RYi`/`RVi`). This is richer than the single `AVE_ERROR` scalar the
code already captured via `CALIBRATE_RESULT_SUMMARY` — but
`Calibration._poll_for_result` was explicitly discarding it (the existing
comment "ignore CALIB_START_PT/CALIB_RESULT_PT progress records" covered this
line too). **No n-point comparison/tradeoff metric was built** — that's
explicitly deferred until real n-point data collection with a cooperative
subject; this session only added the raw capture.

**Changes, all in `src/engine/calibration.py`:**
- New `_parse_calib_result(attrs)` helper: finds every point index present as
  `CALXi` and builds `{"point", "target_x", "target_y", "left": {"x","y",
  "valid"}, "right": {...}}` per point (a missing eye's keys → `None` for that
  eye, not a crash).
- `CalibrationResult` gets a new field `per_point: tuple[dict, ...] | None =
  None` (a tuple, not a list, to stay compatible with the frozen/slotted
  dataclass).
- `_poll_for_result`'s read loop now also matches `tag == "CAL" and
  attrs.get("ID") == "CALIB_RESULT"`, parses it, and attaches it to every
  `CalibrationResult` the method can return. **Known, accepted limitation:**
  if `CALIB_RESULT` arrives *after* the qualifying `CALIBRATE_RESULT_SUMMARY`
  line within the same socket read, the method's existing early-return will
  miss it — best-effort enrichment, not a regression of the existing scalar
  result.
- `save_calibration_result()`/`load_calibration_result()` read/write the new
  `"per_point"` key. Unlike every other field in `calibration.json` (which
  hard-fail via `CalibrationFileError` if missing), `per_point`'s absence is
  **not** an error — `.get("per_point")` defaults to `None` — so a
  `calibration.json` written before this change still loads fine.

**Tests added, `tests/test_calibration.py`:**
`test_run_captures_calib_result_per_point_breakdown`,
`test_run_returns_none_per_point_when_calib_result_never_sent`,
`test_save_then_load_round_trips_per_point`,
`test_load_calibration_file_without_per_point_key_still_loads`.

## 6. Live validation (§2/§3, qt-mcp)

Launched `tools/fake_gazepoint_server.py 4243` (device-free testing, per this
project's established convention) and the dashboard
(`QT_MCP_PROBE=1 QT_MCP_PORT=9142 python -m src.main --dashboard`), maximized
first per this project's own qt-mcp gotcha. Full flow, subject `TESTRESULTS`,
task `click_static`:

1. Connect → "Connected."; Do Calibration → "Calibration measured — 5 points,
   mean error 8px, valid." (`calibration.json`'s `per_point` was `null` here,
   as expected — the fake server sends `CALIBRATE_RESULT_SUMMARY` only, no
   `CALIB_RESULT`).
2. Continue to Tasks → Run (Static Click) → task view appeared, live
   HUD showed `Trial: 2/32`, `0 hit 1 timeout` (fake server streams no gaze
   samples, so every trial times out — expected, not a bug).
3. "End task" → **Results page appeared** showing: Task `click_static`,
   Subject `TESTRESULTS`, Session `2026-09-09_TESTRESULTS_click_static_run1`;
   Trials 2, Hits 0, Hit rate 0.0%, Timeouts 2, Mean reaction time "—"; every
   Gaze-quality field correctly "—"/0 (no gaze stream from the fake server).
4. "Continue" → correctly returned to Tasks with status badge "Complete",
   run buttons and "Setup" nav re-enabled.
5. Confirmed on disk: `sessions/2026-09-09_TESTRESULTS_click_static_run1/
   session_metrics.json` matched the Results page's numbers exactly;
   `calibration.json` had `"per_point": null` as expected.

Test session directory deleted afterward (`sessions/` is gitignored — see
`.gitignore:18` — so this never touched git status).

## 7. Test status

Full `pytest` (`collected 122 items`, `1 failed, 121 passed`) — the failure is
`tests/test_task_pipeline.py::test_config_merges_task_over_default`
(`cfg["app"]["target_fps"] == 60` fails, actual `150`), the same single
pre-existing, unrelated failure recorded before this session's changes
(local `configs/default.yaml`/`configs/local_state.json` drift, not caused by
any change in this SPEC).

## 8. Design-only redesign round (§3's flow superseded)

**Trigger:** the user audited §3's just-built GUI via a real screenshot and
gave feedback redesigning the whole results/calibration-quality flow,
referencing a colleague's reference UI at `resources/images/diki-ui-3.png` (a
diki "Operator Dashboard" mockup: a 4-category metrics table — Data quality,
Fixation, Saccade, Selection — plus a Session Log panel). **Explicit scope for
this round, stated by the user: SPEC/design only, no implementation** — "The
implementation will be done later after I clear the context." Three
architectural forks were resolved via `AskUserQuestion` before wireframing;
resolutions folded directly into §8.1-§8.3 below.

### 8.1 Calibration quality-check — "View Calibration Details"

A new button, **"View Calibration Details,"** placed next to Do
Calibration/Load Calibration File on the Setup page, gated the same way
Continue to Tasks already is (disabled until a calibration result exists).
Clicking it expands an **inline section in place** under the Calibration card
— **not a modal dialog** (user's explicit choice; a modal would also block
the qt-mcp automation probe during testing, per
[[qt-mcp-tool-reference]]'s already-documented `QDialog.exec()` gotcha, and
this dashboard already prefers inline expansion elsewhere).

Contents: the existing one-line summary (unchanged), plus a **new per-point
breakdown table** — Point #, Target (X, Y), Left eye estimate (X, Y) + valid,
Right eye estimate (X, Y) + valid, and a **new derived per-point Error (px)**
column (Euclidean distance, target vs. each eye's estimate — not computed
anywhere in this codebase yet, would need to be added alongside this UI).
Sourced from `CalibrationResult.per_point` (§5 above). **Placeholder/empty
state:** when `per_point` is `None` (older `calibration.json`, or a device
path that never sent `CALIB_RESULT`), the table becomes a single centered row,
"Per-point breakdown not available for this calibration." — the summary alert
above still renders normally either way.

Wireframed at `docs/wireframes/setup.md` (new "Calibration Details (expanded
state — illustrative)" section) / `setup.html`.

### 8.2 §3's Results page is superseded — dedicated "3 · Results" tab instead

**§3's behavior (auto-show a Results page the instant a task run finishes,
before returning to Tasks) is superseded as of this round.** New design: a
task run finishing returns **directly to the Tasks page**, exactly like
before §3 existed. Results instead becomes **a dedicated third persistent
top-level nav tab, "3 · Results,"** alongside the existing "1 · Setup" /
"2 · Tasks" — reachable either by clicking that tab directly, or via each
task card's **"Analyze"** button (enabled only once that task shows
"Complete"). Per the user's explicit choice, it shows **the most recent run
only** for whichever task was last analyzed — no run-picker in this phase,
even though re-runs already get their own `_run1`/`_run2`/... session
folders on disk.

**This is a design decision, not yet code** — §3's `ResultsPage`/
`dashboard_window.py` wiring described above still auto-shows after every run
as originally built; reverting it into this new flow, and building the new
tab, are both future implementation work (see the Status header).

### 8.3 Dedicated Results page layout — modeled on `diki-ui-3.png`

Layout: a page header naming the task + trial count (e.g. "Static Click — 32
trials"), then **four metric-category tables**, in this exact order, matching
the reference image's own structure:

1. **Data quality** — Valid samples, On-screen samples, Effective rate,
   Calibration error (raw), Longest gap
2. **Fixation** — Mean duration, Median duration, Rate
3. **Saccade** — Mean amplitude, Mean direction, Latency (to first fixation)
4. **Selection** — Hit rate, Median RT, Mean attempts, Mean revisits, Trials
   needing re-attempt, plus a conditional warning banner (e.g. "! valid share
   62% below the 80% floor") when Valid samples falls below a floor

...then a **Session Log** panel at the bottom, showing `session.log` verbatim
— this needs **no new capture at all**, `SessionRecorder` already writes it
every run today; only a UI panel to display it is new.

Wireframed at `docs/wireframes/results.md` / `results.html` (new files), with
`docs/wireframes/_nav.md` updated to add the "Results" link (now a 3-page
nav) and `docs/wireframes/tasks.md` updated with a design note clarifying
Run→Tasks (not Results) and Analyze→`results.md`.

### 8.4 Metrics-category gap report (given to the user before wireframing)

Of the reference image's ~19 metric rows, **9 already have real data behind
them in this codebase today**: `valid_ratio`, calibration `mean_error_px`,
fixation mean/median duration, fixation rate, `hit_rate`, raw
`time_to_first_fixation_ms` per trial, raw `attempts` per trial, and
`session.log` itself. The remaining rows split into two gap classes, **none
implemented this session**:

- **Cheap — aggregation only, over data already recorded** (~6 rows):
  effective rate (`n_samples`/duration), longest gap (max consecutive `t_ns`
  delta), median RT, mean attempts, trials needing re-attempt
  (`attempts > 1` count), a session-level mean latency-to-first-fixation
  aggregate.
- **Needs genuinely new tracking/capture logic** (~3 rows): on-screen bounds
  check (x/y within `[0,1]`), saccade amplitude/direction (needs fixation
  *centroid* tracking — today only fixation-id transitions are counted, not
  positions), mean revisits (needs on-target entry/exit tracking, not just
  first-fixation + attempt count).

The wireframe at `results.md` uses "—" placeholders for every not-yet-computed
row, matching the reference image's own convention for empty/pending values.

### 8.5 Process rule adopted this round

**Any future UI design/creation task in this project must produce a
wireframe via the `/wireframe` skill first, before implementation** — adopted
per the user's explicit instruction this round, going forward for all future
sessions, not just this one.

### 8.6 What was actually touched this round (files, not app code)

`docs/wireframes/_nav.md` (added the Results link), `docs/wireframes/setup.md`
+ `setup.html` (new button + inline expanded-state section, re-rendered and
re-themed via `tools/apply_wtmh_wireframe_theme.py`), `docs/wireframes/
tasks.md` + `tasks.html` (design-note update only — re-rendered/re-themed to
keep the HTML in sync with the `.md`, but not independently re-screenshotted
since the change was text-only), new `docs/wireframes/results.md` +
`results.html`. **`setup.html` and `results.html`** were verified visually via
a Playwright screenshot (`file:///.../docs/wireframes/{setup,results}.html`)
— confirmed correct against the WTMH Clinical Teal palette, including
catching and fixing a real wiremd rendering quirk: `|Yes|{.success}` badge
syntax does **not** parse inside a markdown table cell (prints the literal
attribute string instead) — fixed by using plain "Yes"/"No" text in the
per-point breakdown table. **No file under `src/` or `tests/` was touched
this round.**

## 9. §8.1-§8.3 implemented and live-validated

**All of §8's design is now built.** New/changed files, all in
`dev/peds-eye-gaze-assessment/`:

- `src/data/exporter.py` — `compute_fixation_saccade_metrics()` gained
  `on_screen_ratio` (fraction of valid samples whose normalized x/y both fall
  in `[0, 1]`), `effective_rate_hz` (`n_samples / duration_s`), and
  `longest_gap_s` (max consecutive `t_ns` delta). `summarize()` gained
  `median_reaction_time_ms`, `mean_attempts` (over *all* trials, including
  0-attempt timeouts — a deliberate choice, not a bug, since a trial that was
  never clicked is still a real data point for the mean), `n_trials_needing_
  reattempt` (`attempts > 1` count), and `mean_time_to_first_fixation_ms`.
- `src/engine/calibration.py` — new `per_point_errors_px(per_point,
  screen_width_px, screen_height_px)`: per-eye Euclidean pixel error (target
  vs. estimate, normalized coordinates scaled by the configured screen
  dimensions, same convention as `BaseTask.set_screen_size`). An eye with
  `valid: false` still gets an error computed if its estimate is present —
  validity and "was a distance computed" are different questions.
- `src/ui/setup_page.py` — new "View Calibration Details" button (disabled
  until a calibration result exists, same gating as Continue to Tasks),
  toggling an inline `QTableWidget` per-point breakdown (Point / Target (X,Y)
  / Left eye (X,Y) / Left valid / Right eye (X,Y) / Right valid / Error (px))
  under the Calibration card — not a modal, per §8.1. Shows "Per-point
  breakdown not available for this calibration." when `per_point` is `None`.
  Collapses on every new `Do Calibration`/`Load Calibration File` result so a
  stale table from a prior subject/run can never linger visible.
- `src/ui/wtmh_theme.py` — new `QTableWidget`/`QHeaderView` styling (no table
  had ever been themed in this app before); `QPlainTextEdit` added to the
  existing input-field theming block (see the real bug below).
- `src/ui/results_page.py` — **fully rewritten**, not incrementally changed,
  from §3's single-card summary+gaze-quality form into §8.3's design: a page
  header (task name + trial count), a conditional warning banner (shown when
  valid-sample share falls below an 80% floor, per §8.3's example wording),
  four metric-category cards — **Data quality** / **Fixation** / **Saccade**
  / **Selection** — and a **Session Log** panel showing `session.log`
  verbatim. Implemented as `QFormLayout` metric→value rows inside
  `QFrame#wtmhCard` cards (reusing the existing card pattern) rather than a
  literal `QTableWidget` per category — a deliberate simplification, visually
  equivalent to the wireframe's table rows without introducing new per-row
  widget styling. Per §8.4's gap classes, **Saccade's Mean amplitude/Mean
  direction and Selection's Mean revisits are deliberately left "—"** — they
  need fixation-centroid/on-target-revisit tracking this codebase still
  doesn't capture, not implemented this round. The page's signal was renamed
  `continue_requested` → `backRequested` (no more "continue past a blocking
  step" semantics — Results is just a tab now).
- `src/ui/tasks_page.py` — `_TASK_INFO` renamed to public `TASK_INFO` (now
  also imported by `results_page.py` for task display names). `_TaskCard`/
  `TasksPage` gained an `analyzeRequested(task_id)` signal wired to the
  previously-inert Analyze button (was permanently disabled with a "Coming
  soon" tooltip since §6.2; now enabled exactly when that task's status is
  "Complete", matching the existing status-badge logic).
- `src/ui/dashboard_window.py` — the core rewiring. §3's auto-show-Results-
  after-every-run behavior and its `_viewing_results` flag are gone entirely;
  `_on_task_finished` now returns straight to Tasks (the pre-§3 behavior),
  but records the finished run's session dir into a new `self._task_session_
  dirs: dict[str, Path]` keyed by `task_id` — most-recent-run-only, per
  §8.2's explicit no-run-picker decision (a same-day re-run overwrites the
  prior entry, on-disk `_run<N>` folders are untouched either way). A third,
  persistent "Results" nav button now sits alongside Setup/Tasks in the title
  bar. New `_on_analyze_requested(task_id)` populates `ResultsPage` from
  `_task_session_dirs` and switches to it — reachable via a task's own
  Analyze button or the Results nav button directly, at any time, not just
  right after that task's own run.

### 9.1 Real bug found and fixed: `session.log` was silently empty

**This SPEC's own §8.3 claimed the Session Log panel "needs no new capture
at all... `SessionRecorder` already writes it every run today" — verified
FALSE live, not just re-read.** After building the panel, a live qt-mcp run
against `tools/fake_gazepoint_server.py` showed it as a solid black,
completely empty box. `qt_get_text` on the widget confirmed 0 characters,
and reading the session's actual `session.log` off disk confirmed it was a
genuine 0-byte file, not a display bug. Tracing `src/app.py` found
`SessionRecorder.log()` was called from exactly one place in the entire
codebase — `_apply_setting()`'s live-settings-panel change handler — so any
run where the operator never touched a live slider produced a `session.log`
with nothing in it at all, despite the file always being created.

**Fixed in `src/app.py`:** `AssessmentApp.__init__` now logs "Session
started: `<session_id>`", "Connected to Gazepoint Control." (only when this
instance owns the client — the dashboard's embedded-run path reuses an
already-connected client from Setup, so nothing new was connected this run,
and the log correctly omits that line in that case), and a calibration-
result line ("Calibration measured — N points, mean error Xpx, valid." or
"...invalid or unmeasured." for a failed/skipped calibration) — all three
deferred until right after `self.recorder.open()`, even though connect/
calibrate both happen earlier, because calibration must run before the
recorder exists (same ordering constraint documented in [[peds-eye-gaze-
assessment-calibration-fix-2026-08-31]]) and `recorder.log()` needs an open
file handle. A "Running `<task_id>` (N trials) at WxH." line was added right
after `build_task()`. `_shutdown()` now logs "Wrote N trials -> `<path>`"
right after `write_trials()`. Two style tokens (`QPlainTextEdit` missing from
`wtmh_theme.py`'s themed-input list) were fixed in the same round — see the
file list above — since the panel rendering solid black was a second,
separate symptom of the same investigation (a styling gap, not a data gap).

**Two of the two combined fixes were both real and independently necessary**
— fixing only the empty-log data bug would have left a themed-but-blank
panel; fixing only the QPlainTextEdit styling would have left a correctly
light-themed but permanently empty panel. Re-verified live after both fixes
together: `session.log` for a real run now reads (verbatim, from a live QA
session):
```
Session started: 2026-09-09_RESULTQA01_click_static_run1
Calibration measured — 5 points, mean error 8.4px, valid.
Running click_static (32 trials) at 1920x1080.
Wrote 0 trials -> sessions\2026-09-09_RESULTQA01_click_static_run1\trials.csv
```
("Connected to Gazepoint Control." absent here because the dashboard's Setup
tab already owned the connection, as expected; "Wrote 0 trials" because the
QA run was ended immediately via End task, not because of a bug.)

**How to apply:** `run_headless_replay()` (`src/engine/task_runner.py`) was
**not** touched by this fix — the Session Log panel is a GUI-only (dashboard)
feature, and a headless `--replay` session's `session.log` remains whatever
it was before. If a future session wants headless replay sessions to carry
the same narrative (e.g. for `analysis/analyze_session.py`-driven review),
that's separate, unstarted work.

### 9.2 Live validation (qt-mcp)

`tools/fake_gazepoint_server.py 4244` (a port other than 4242/4243, both
already bound by the real Gazepoint Control app on this machine, per
[[peds-eye-gaze-assessment-calibration-crash-2026-09-09]]'s established
convention) + `QT_MCP_PROBE=1 QT_MCP_PORT=9142 python -m src.main
--dashboard`, `showMaximized()`'d first per [[feedback-qt-mcp-maximize-
before-validating]]. Full flow, subject `RESULTQA01`:

1. Connect → "Connected."; Sex → Female; Do Calibration → "Calibration
   measured — 5 points, mean error 8px, valid."
2. **View Calibration Details** → correctly showed "Per-point breakdown not
   available for this calibration." (the fake server never sends
   `CALIB_RESULT`, only `CALIBRATE_RESULT_SUMMARY` — the intended empty-state
   path, confirmed live; the populated-table path is covered by
   `per_point_errors_px`'s own unit tests instead, since no real device was
   available this round).
3. Continue to Tasks → Run (Static Click) → **End task** → confirmed landed
   directly back on **Tasks**, status "Complete" — **not** an auto-shown
   Results page, confirming §3's old behavior is gone.
4. Task cards' **Analyze** buttons: confirmed only the just-completed task's
   button was enabled (the other three stayed disabled, per the existing
   "Complete"-gated logic) — clicked it.
5. **Results tab rendered correctly**: header "Static Click — 0 trials",
   subject/session subtitle, all four category cards populated (mostly "—"
   since the fake server streams no gaze data — expected, matches §6's
   original live-validation pattern), Session Log panel showing the real
   4-line narrative from §9.1 above, properly light-themed (not black).
6. **Back to Tasks** button confirmed working; the persistent **Results** nav
   button (title bar) also confirmed reachable independent of Analyze.

Two full dashboard relaunches were needed mid-round: one caught a real
`ImportError` (a leftover `_TASK_INFO` reference in `results_page.py` after
the `TASK_INFO` rename, missed on the first pass — the launch log itself
surfaced it immediately, not a silent failure) — see this as a reminder that
a rename touching multiple files needs a grep-and-relaunch check, not just an
editor-wide search that feels complete. The second relaunch picked up the
§9.1 `app.py` fix. Scratch QA session directories deleted afterward
(`sessions/` is gitignored, so this never touched `git status`); both QA
processes (dashboard + fake server, ports 9142/4244) killed cleanly via
`taskkill /F /T`, confirmed no leftover listeners via `netstat`.

### 9.3 Test status

Full pytest run three times across this round (after the exporter/
calibration additions, after fixing an accidental test-file splice caught by
the very next run, and after the §9.1 `app.py` fix): consistently **125
passed, 1 pre-existing unrelated failure** (126 collected total — corrected
here 2026-09-09 during a `/spec-memory-audit` pass; an earlier draft of this
section misstated it as "131 passed," not verified against an actual count
at the time it was written)
(`test_config_merges_task_over_default`, the long-documented `target_fps`
60-vs-150 local config drift — see [[peds-eye-gaze-assessment-config-skip-
worktree-2026-09-03]]). New tests: `tests/test_recorder.py` (on_screen_ratio,
effective_rate_hz, longest_gap_s, an off-screen-sample case, and the new
`summarize()` fields), `tests/test_calibration.py`
(`test_per_point_errors_px_*`, 3 new cases).

`run_headless_replay()`/`analysis/analyze_session.py` were not touched this
round beyond what §2 already covers — no new headless-path tests were
needed.

## 11. Results page has no scroll (2026-09-17) — implemented and live-validated

### 11.1 Reported

User feedback: "Do a small update on the result UI, currently it doesn't
have scroll." (§10 below is a log-only entry, hence this section's number.)

### 11.2 Diagnosis

`ResultsPage` (`src/ui/results_page.py`) stacked its four metric cards
(5 + 3 + 3 + 6 form rows), the warning banner, and the fixed-height (140 px)
Session Log card directly in the page's outer `QVBoxLayout`. No
`QScrollArea` anywhere on the page — the only two in the app were Setup's
card stack (`SPEC-ui-setup-task-selection.md` §22) and the OperatorPanel
(`SPEC-live-settings-panel.md` §10.10).

Measured live (real Windows fonts, maximized 1920×1009 — never offscreen,
per `SPEC-live-settings-panel.md` §10.10's rule): the content stack is
**978 px** tall against an **869 px** viewport, so even at this machine's
maximized size the Session Log card was cut off at the bottom, with no way
to reach it. Any shorter window (1600×900, 125 % scaling) loses more.

### 11.3 Fix

Same shape as Setup's §22: the header row (page title + "← Back to Tasks")
stays pinned outside; `self._content` (everything else, unchanged) becomes
the widget of a new `QScrollArea#wtmhResultsScroll` with
`setWidgetResizable(True)`, no frame, horizontal bar always off, and
`addStretch(1)` at the end of the content layout so a tall viewport doesn't
stretch the cards apart. Both §22 gotchas applied:

- §22.5 — `setWidget()` turns on `autoFillBackground` for the viewport
  *and* the content widget; the QSS transparent rule reaches only the
  viewport, so both are cleared explicitly in code (otherwise black bands
  appear in the 16 px gaps between cards).
- §22.6 — the app-wide themed `QScrollBar` rule in `wtmh_theme.py` already
  covers it; the `QScrollArea#wtmhSetupScroll` transparent-background
  selector was widened to also match `#wtmhResultsScroll` rather than
  duplicating the rule.

Files: `src/ui/results_page.py`, `src/ui/wtmh_theme.py`. No behaviour change
to `populate()` or to what is displayed; `tests/` has no Qt-layer coverage
(project convention), so no test edits. Suite unchanged: **200 collected,
199 passed, 1 pre-existing unrelated failure** (`target_fps` drift).

### 11.4 Live validation (qt-mcp, `tools/fake_gazepoint_server.py` on 4250)

Port 4242 was held by the real Gazepoint Control this session (no gaze
subject available), so the fake server ran on 4250 and the Setup page's
port field was set to match. Subject `SCROLLRES`, calibration via the fake
server, Static Click run and ended via the OperatorPanel's "End task"
shortcut, then Analyze.

| Check | Observed |
|---|---|
| Scroll area present | `QScrollArea "wtmhResultsScroll"` 1872×869, `minimumSizeHint` 58×58 (so the page can no longer force the window taller than the screen) |
| Overflow is real | vertical `QScrollBar` `maximum: 109`, `pageStep: 869` → content 978 px |
| Top of page | header row pinned; Session Log card clipped at the bottom, scrollbar thumb visible at right (window screenshot, not a widget grab) |
| Scrolled to `value: 109` | full Session Log card visible with its 4 log lines; header + Back button still pinned; no black bands between cards |
| Window size | `DashboardWindow` stays 1920×1009 before and after showing Results (did not auto-grow) |

Not exercised: the empty state ("No results yet…") — that label sits
outside the scroll area and is untouched.

**qt-mcp gotcha hit (new):** a `qt_wait_for` with `timeout_ms` ≥ the MCP
client's own ~30 s limit desynchronises the probe channel by one reply —
every subsequent tool result is the *previous* call's answer (a
`qt_screenshot` came back as `'image'` KeyError, `qt_list_windows` as "no
windows" while the app was alive). Relaunching the target app resets it.
Keep `qt_wait_for` timeouts well under 30 s and poll instead.

**Cleanup:** `SCROLLRES` session/calibration/settings artifacts deleted,
dashboard + fake server killed, ports 4250/9142 confirmed closed,
`configs/local_state.json` restored 4250 → `127.0.0.1:4242`.

## 12. Calibration source in the Session Log + stale `target_fps` test (2026-10-05) — APPROVED, not yet built

Two small backlog items from `/spec-backlog` (2026-10-05, items #4 and #5),
designed with the user via `AskUserQuestion` the same day. No UI layout
change, so no wireframe step.

### 12.1 Problem A — Session Log always says "measured"

`AssessmentApp.__init__` writes the calibration line unconditionally as
`"Calibration measured — …"` (`src/app.py:376-380`), whatever the
calibration's origin. Found live on 2026-09-09 (see the Log): the Setup
page's alert said "loaded", the Session Log said "measured". The cause is
structural: the dashboard always hands the task a ready
`preset_calibration_result` (`src/ui/dashboard_window.py:412`), so
`AssessmentApp` cannot tell a Setup-page measurement from a file load.

### 12.2 Design A (user decision: "pass the real source", incl. metadata)

- New `AssessmentApp.__init__` keyword `preset_calibration_source: str | None = None`
  with values `"measured"` or `"loaded"`, plus `preset_calibration_file: str | None = None`
  (the file name/path the result was loaded from, when loaded).
- `SetupPage` remembers the source of its current `_calibration_result`:
  `"measured"` when it comes from `_on_calibration_finished` (valid result),
  `"loaded"` + the chosen path when it comes from the Load Calibration
  action. Expose both via read-only properties next to `calibration_result`.
  Clearing the result (invalid run, failed load) clears the source too.
- `DashboardWindow` passes both into `AssessmentApp` alongside
  `preset_calibration_result`.
- Resolved source inside `AssessmentApp`:
  - `--calibration-file` given → `"loaded"`, file = that path;
  - preset given with an explicit source → that source (and file);
  - preset given with no source (any other caller) → `"loaded"`;
  - fresh `Calibration.run()` that is not the stub → `"measured"`;
  - stub / `calibration.enabled: false` → `"not run"`.
- Session Log wording (keep the existing tail of each line):
  - measured: `Calibration measured — {n} points, mean error {e}, valid.` (unchanged);
  - loaded: `Calibration loaded from {file name} — {n} points, mean error {e}, valid.`
    (file name = `Path(file).name`; when no file is known: `Calibration loaded — …`);
  - invalid/unmeasured: `Calibration {source} — {n} points, invalid or unmeasured.`;
  - not run: `Calibration not run — {n} points, invalid or unmeasured.`
- `metadata.json`: new optional `SessionMetadata.calibration_source: str | None = None`
  (`"measured"` / `"loaded"` / `"not run"`). Additive: readers must tolerate
  its absence in older sessions.

### 12.3 Problem B / Design B — stale test

`tests/test_task_pipeline.py::test_config_merges_task_over_default` asserts
`cfg["app"]["target_fps"] == 60`, but the committed `configs/default.yaml`
has `150` since the target-fps change, so the test fails on any clean
checkout (it is not only local skip-worktree drift, as earlier notes said).
User decision: compare against `default.yaml` itself — load
`configs/default.yaml` with `yaml.safe_load` in the test and assert the
merged `app.target_fps` equals its value. The test then checks the merge,
not a tuning value.

### 12.4 Scope

In: `src/app.py`, `src/ui/setup_page.py`, `src/ui/dashboard_window.py`,
`src/data/schema.py`, `tests/test_task_pipeline.py`, new/updated tests.
Out: any UI layout/text change on the Setup page; any change to
`Calibration.run()`; `configs/default.yaml` and `configs/local_state.json`
(off-limits); the `_record_geometry()` unit mix (separate backlog item).

### 12.5 Acceptance criteria

1. Unit test: an `AssessmentApp` (or the extracted log-line helper) given a
   preset with source `"loaded"` and file `…/calibration_5pt.json` logs
   `Calibration loaded from calibration_5pt.json — 5 points, …`; with
   `"measured"` logs the unchanged measured line. Each new test must fail
   without the fix.
2. `--calibration-file` path logs "loaded" and records `calibration_source: "loaded"`.
3. `metadata.json` has `calibration_source` for measured, loaded and stub runs.
4. `SetupPage` source tracking: measured → `"measured"`; load → `"loaded"` + path;
   invalid run → source cleared.
5. `test_config_merges_task_over_default` passes on the current config, and
   would still pass if `target_fps` were changed in `default.yaml`.
6. Full suite: **0 failures** (the long-standing known failure is gone).
7. Live check (hub + user): one dashboard run with a calibration loaded
   from file → its `session.log` says "loaded from …" and `metadata.json`
   says `"loaded"`; one run after Do Calibration → "measured".

### 12.6 Impl log (implementer appends here)

### 12.7 Open questions (implementer writes here and returns; does not decide)

## Log

- **2026-09-09 — §1-§5 above implemented, unit-tested, and (§2/§3) live-
  validated via qt-mcp, all via `/sparc:orchestrator`.** Files changed:
  `src/data/exporter.py`, `src/app.py`, `src/engine/task_runner.py`,
  `analysis/analyze_session.py`, `src/ui/results_page.py` (new),
  `src/ui/dashboard_window.py`, `src/engine/calibration.py`,
  `tests/test_task_pipeline.py`, `tests/test_calibration.py`. **Left
  uncommitted**, same ask-before-commit pattern as the rest of this project's
  SPEC docs.

- **2026-09-09, later — §8: design-only redesign round, via
  `/sparc:orchestrator`, explicitly no implementation this round.** User
  audited §3's Results page against a real screenshot and, referencing
  `resources/images/diki-ui-3.png`, asked for: (1) a calibration
  quality-check button/section, (2) §3's auto-show-after-run Results page
  **superseded** by a dedicated persistent "3 · Results" tab reached via
  Analyze, (3) that tab modeled on the reference image's 4-category table
  layout, and (4) a metrics-category gap report before any wireframing.
  Three architectural forks resolved via `AskUserQuestion` (nav-tab-vs-
  button-only → persistent tab; modal-vs-inline for calibration details →
  inline; single-run-vs-run-picker for Results → most-recent-run-only). Gap
  report produced and given to the user (§8.4) before wireframing, per their
  explicit "report to me first." Two wireframes built and live-verified via
  Playwright screenshots (§8.6); a mandatory wireframe-before-UI-
  implementation process rule adopted (§8.5). **Confirmed: zero `src/`/
  `tests/` changes this round** — only `docs/wireframes/*` and this SPEC.
  Implementation of §8.1-§8.3 (including reverting §3's now-superseded
  auto-show behavior) is deferred to a future session, per the user's own
  explicit instruction.

- **2026-09-09, later still — §9: §8.1-§8.3 implemented and live-validated,
  via `/sparc:orchestrator` (session resumed after a `/clear`, restored via
  `/memory-restore`).** Every item from §8's design is now built: the
  Setup-page "View Calibration Details" inline section, the dedicated
  persistent "3 · Results" nav tab (reached via the Results button or a
  completed task's Analyze button), and the 4-category metric layout.
  §3's old auto-show-after-run Results page is fully reverted — a run now
  returns straight to Tasks, exactly as §8.2 specified. A real bug was found
  and fixed along the way (not part of the original plan): this SPEC's own
  §8.3 had claimed the Session Log panel needed no new capture, which live
  qt-mcp testing proved false — `session.log` was silently empty for any
  ordinary run before this round's fix to `src/app.py` (§9.1 has the full
  account). Full live-validation walkthrough: §9.2. Test status: §9.3 (125
  passed, 1 pre-existing unrelated failure, no regressions). **Files
  changed:** `src/data/exporter.py`, `src/engine/calibration.py`,
  `src/ui/setup_page.py`, `src/ui/wtmh_theme.py`, `src/ui/results_page.py`,
  `src/ui/tasks_page.py`, `src/ui/dashboard_window.py`, `src/app.py`,
  `tests/test_recorder.py`, `tests/test_calibration.py`. **Left
  uncommitted**, same ask-before-commit pattern as the rest of this SPEC's
  history — nothing from this whole Result-logic line of work is on
  `origin/main` yet.

- **2026-09-09, later still — `/spec-memory-audit` (one real fix), then
  §1-§9 committed and pushed, via `/sparc:orchestrator`.** Audit verified
  log chronology (clean), every §9 code claim against current source
  (`backRequested`/`analyzeRequested`/`_task_session_dirs`/all 6
  `recorder.log()` call sites in `src/app.py` — all matched exactly), and
  all 3 cross-links in the touched memory file (all resolve). **Found and
  fixed one real discrepancy:** §9.3's "131 passed" claim was wrong — an
  actual pytest re-run showed **125 passed, 1 pre-existing failure, 126
  collected total**, corrected here and in the Log entry above (the overall
  "no regressions, 1 known pre-existing failure" conclusion was still
  correct, only the raw count was off). All of §1-§9 (this whole Result-
  logic/Calibration-Details/Results-tab line of work) committed as one
  commit, `9d6e8d3`, pushed to `origin/main` (`9049e57..9d6e8d3`). `git
  status` clean after push — nothing from this SPEC remains uncommitted.

- **2026-09-09, later still — §10: qt-mcp-driven end-to-end demo recording
  of the Results-tab feature (Setup → Calibration → Task → Results) for a
  user report, via `/sparc:orchestrator`.** User wanted to record (their own
  OBS capture, this session driving) a full walkthrough of §9's new Results
  tab without a live gaze subject. Investigated first: `DashboardWindow`'s
  embedded task-run path hardcodes `replay_path=None`
  (`src/ui/dashboard_window.py:199`), so a real `--replay` fixture only
  works through the old standalone `--task X --gui` CLI path (`MainWindow`),
  not the persistent dashboard — flagged to the user as a real gap, not
  fixed (out of scope this round; see
  [[peds-eye-gaze-assessment-dashboard-testing-without-subject-2026-09-09]]).

  Chosen path instead (`AskUserQuestion`): extended `tools/
  fake_gazepoint_server.py`'s streamed `REC` from a single fixed point to a
  9-waypoint cycle (matching `click_static.yaml`'s own 8 positions + center),
  held ~1.8s each as a real "fixation" — `FPOGID` increments/`FPOGD` resets
  on each waypoint change, so `compute_fixation_saccade_metrics` gets
  genuine (if synthetic) fixation/saccade segmentation instead of one
  perpetual fixation. Smoke-tested standalone first (confirmed `FPOGID`/
  `FPOGD` sequencing over a raw socket) before driving the real app. Full
  pytest suite: 125 passed, 1 pre-existing failure, no regressions (this
  tool has no direct test coverage).

  Live-drove via `qt-mcp` against this fake server (port 4244 — 4242/4243
  bound by the real Gazepoint Control app) + the dashboard (probe port
  9142), two full passes for subject `DEMO01`:
  1. **Do Calibration path:** Connect → fill subject fields → Do Calibration
     (valid, 5 points) → View Calibration Details (correctly "not
     available" — the fake server sends no `CALIB_RESULT`) → Continue → ran
     Grid Click (18 trials) to completion → Results (reached both via
     Analyze and the persistent nav tab) showing real Data Quality/
     Fixation/Saccade/Selection numbers and a populated Session Log.
     Session: `sessions/2026-09-09_DEMO01_click_grid_run1`.
  2. **Load Calibration File path:** reused run 1's `calibration.json` for
     the same subject. **New qt-mcp finding:** clicking "Load Calibration
     File" opens a native `QFileDialog`, which blocks the click's own RPC
     call the same way a custom `.exec()` modal does — `qt_click` doesn't
     return until the dialog closes. Worked around by firing a backgrounded
     PowerShell `SendKeys` script (types the target file's full path +
     Enter) in parallel with the `qt_click` call. **This recovered cleanly
     — no process kill/relaunch needed once the dialog closed**, unlike the
     already-documented custom-`QDialog` `.exec()` gotcha (see
     [[qt-mcp-tool-reference]], now updated with this distinction). Ran
     Grid Click again → correctly created `..._click_grid_run2` (the
     run-index collision-avoidance feature), confirming it also works from
     a *loaded* (not just freshly-measured) calibration. Session: `sessions/
     2026-09-09_DEMO01_click_grid_run2`.

  **New real (cosmetic) bug found, flagged not fixed:** the Session Log's
  calibration line is written unconditionally as "Calibration measured —
  ..." (`src/app.py:287-294`), regardless of whether `cal` came from a
  fresh `Calibration.run()` or a loaded/reused file — confirmed live in
  run 2's Session Log, which said "measured" even though the Setup page's
  own on-screen alert correctly said "loaded". Session naming/metadata/
  timestamps are all correct; this is wording only. Left for a future
  session if the user wants it fixed.

  Both processes killed after recording (each had a venv-launcher +
  resolved-interpreter PID pair on Windows); ports 4244/9142 confirmed
  freed. **Both demo session directories deliberately preserved** at the
  user's explicit request — `sessions/` is gitignored, so this never
  touched `git status` either way. **Files changed:** `tools/
  fake_gazepoint_server.py` only (docstring, `WAYPOINTS`/`FIXATION_HOLD_S`
  constants, `send_rec_loop()`). No `src`/`tests` changes this round.

- **2026-09-17 — §11: Results page given a scroll area, implemented and
  live-validated, via `/sparc:orchestrator`.** User feedback that the
  Results UI "doesn't have scroll". Measured live at maximized 1920×1009:
  content 978 px in an 869 px viewport, Session Log card unreachable. Fix
  is Setup's §22 pattern applied to `ResultsPage` (pinned header row,
  `QScrollArea#wtmhResultsScroll` around the content, both §22 gotchas
  applied, theme selector widened instead of duplicated). Validated via
  qt-mcp against the fake server on 4250 (4242 held by the real Gazepoint
  Control): scrollbar `maximum: 109`, full log card visible after
  scrolling, window stayed 1920×1009. Suite 200 collected / 199 passed /
  1 pre-existing `target_fps` failure. **Files changed:**
  `src/ui/results_page.py`, `src/ui/wtmh_theme.py`, this SPEC. Left
  uncommitted at first, ask-before-commit as always; **then committed and
  pushed at the user's instruction as `1e58491`** (`origin/main`
  `f0c3f38..1e58491`). This log line is recorded in a follow-up doc-only
  commit.

- **2026-10-05 — §12 added: calibration source in the Session Log + stale
  `target_fps` test. Design APPROVED by the user, not yet built.** Raised
  as items #4/#5 by `/spec-backlog`; four `AskUserQuestion` answers fixed
  the design (pass the real source incl. a `calibration_source` metadata
  field; compare the test against `default.yaml`). Correction recorded:
  the `target_fps` test failure is not local config drift; the committed
  `default.yaml` has `150` too. Next: `spec-implementer` builds §12.
