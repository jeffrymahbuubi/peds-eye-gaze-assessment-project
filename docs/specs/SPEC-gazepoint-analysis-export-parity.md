# SPEC-gazepoint-analysis-export-parity — Match Gazepoint Analysis's CSV export from our own recorder

**Status: IMPLEMENTED, tested and live-validated (§9), 2026-09-17.** §1–§4
are findings from the user's sample export (verified against the files, not
the manual alone). §5 (Bucket B/C: raw fields recorded directly into a new
Analysis-layout `all_gaze.csv`), §6 (Bucket D: `SACCADE_MAG`/`SACCADE_DIR`
+ `fixations.csv`, derived at session close and golden-tested against the
vendor's own export), and §4.2's geometry persistence are all built. The
user waived §6's approval gate the same day ("§5 + full §6, skip the
approval gate"), so Stage 1 and Stage 2 landed together. **Committed as `4387319`,
included in the `v1.0.0` tag** (see §10's 2026-09-30 entry).

**Created:** 2026-09-17
**Last updated:** 2026-09-30 (commit-status correction, §10)

## 1. Origin / what was asked

User, 2026-09-17, pointing at `resources/gazepoint-analysis-example-data/`
(top-level project, a real export from Gazepoint Analysis v7.3.0 made
2026-09-10): "Check whether current software already outputs data with the
data fields similar to the .csv or not. If not, check whether the API
exposes these data or not." Then, on the report: add every field the API
exposes (except the biometrics-kit ones) so "the data from the software
custom we made have similar function with the analysis"; for the fields the
API does *not* expose, "report first whether we already have the code to do
this or not, if not add to the SPEC to derive them first then test. After
tested and approved, wire it to the custom software."

This is the "planned next step" `docs/CLINICAL_DATA_REFERENCE.md` §"Gazepoint
Analysis's own session-level summary" had left open since 2026-09-03.

## 2. What the sample export contains (verified)

| File | Rows | Verified structure |
|---|---|---|
| `User 0_all_gaze.csv` | 639 samples × **62 columns** | Every `<REC>` record of the recording, in Gazepoint's own attribute names, plus Analysis-computed columns |
| `User 0_fixations.csv` | 16 rows × same 62 columns | **One row per fixation = the last valid (`FPOGV=1`) sample of each `FPOGID`.** Checked programmatically: the fixation rows' `CNT` (18, 40, 59, 104, …) equal the last-valid-sample `CNT` per `FPOGID` in `all_gaze`; the single-sample fixation `FPOGID=1` at `CNT=0` is dropped |
| `Data_Summary_export_09-10-26-11.39.31_eyetracker.csv` | header only | AOI statistics per user + averages; no data rows because no AOIs were defined in Analysis for this recording |

The 62 columns, in file order:

```
MEDIA_ID, MEDIA_NAME, CNT, TIME(<start datetime>), TIMETICK(f=1000000000),
FPOGX, FPOGY, FPOGS, FPOGD, FPOGID, FPOGV, BPOGX, BPOGY, BPOGV,
CX, CY, CS, KB, KBS, USER,
LPCX, LPCY, LPD, LPS, LPV, RPCX, RPCY, RPD, RPS, RPV,
BKID, BKDUR, BKPMIN, LPMM, LPMMV, RPMM, RPMMV,
DIAL, DIALV, GSR, GSR_US, GSR_US_TONIC, GSR_US_PHASIC, GSRV, HR, HRV, HRP, IBI,
TTL0, TTL1, TTL2, TTL3, TTL4, TTL5, TTL6, TTLV, PIXS, PIXV,
AOI, SACCADE_MAG, SACCADE_DIR, VID_FRAME
```

Two header quirks matter for parity: `TIME(...)` carries the recording's
wall-clock start in the header and counts seconds from **recording start**
(the API's `TIME` counts from Control's last init/calibration — different
origin); `TIMETICK(f=…)` carries the tick frequency in the header.

## 3. What our recorder writes today

`sessions/<run>/gaze_stream.csv` (`GazeSample.as_row`, `src/data/schema.py`):
`t_ns, x, y, valid, fixation_id, fix_duration_s, pupil_left, pupil_right` —
8 columns. Mapping the 62 export columns onto it:

| Bucket | Export columns | Ours |
|---|---|---|
| **A — already written** (6 of 62, collapsed) | `FPOGX/Y` + `BPOGX/Y` → one `x,y` (BPOG when `BPOGV`, else FPOG); `FPOGV` + `BPOGV` → one `valid`; `FPOGID` → `fixation_id` (only when `FPOGV`); `FPOGD` → `fix_duration_s`; `LPMM`/`RPMM` → `pupil_left/right` | `rec_to_sample()`, `src/inputs/gazepoint_client.py` |
| **B — received, discarded** | `TIME` (subscribed via `enable.time`, replaced by host `t_ns`); `FPOGS`; `LPMMV`/`RPMMV`; `CX/CY/CS` (subscribed via `enable.cursor`, never stored) | On the wire already; `rec_to_sample()` drops them |
| **C — API has them, not subscribed** | `CNT`, `TIMETICK`, `KB/KBS`, `USER`, `LPCX/LPCY/LPD/LPS/LPV`, `RPCX/RPCY/RPD/RPS/RPV`, `BKID/BKDUR/BKPMIN`, `PIXS/PIXV` | One `ENABLE_SEND_*` each: `COUNTER`, `TIME_TICK`, `KB`, `USER_DATA`, `PUPIL_LEFT`/`PUPIL_RIGHT`, `BLINK`, `PIX` |
| **C′ — API has them, need the Biometrics kit** | `DIAL/DIALV`, `GSR/GSRV`, `HR/HRV/HRP/IBI`, `TTL0–6/TTLV` | **Excluded by the user.** Read 0 without the kit (the sample shows exactly that) |
| **D — not in the API** | `MEDIA_ID/NAME`, `VID_FRAME`, `AOI`, `SACCADE_MAG`, `SACCADE_DIR`, `GSR_US/_TONIC/_PHASIC` | Computed by Gazepoint Analysis at export (vendor corpus: `docs/gazepoints/synthesis/data-fields-reference.md` §"CSV-only fields") |

Nothing we write corresponds to `_fixations.csv` or `Data_Summary` *as
files*; §6 covers what of them is derivable.

## 4. Bucket D — reverse-engineered from the sample (the part that needed proof)

**`SACCADE_MAG` / `SACCADE_DIR` are fully reproducible from fields we already
record.** Definition, found by fitting the sample:

- Both are 0 on every row except a fixation's **last valid sample**, where
  they describe the jump *from the previous fixation to this one*.
- `SACCADE_MAG` = Euclidean distance in **screen pixels** between the
  previous fixation's `(FPOGX, FPOGY)` and this fixation's, i.e.
  `hypot((x1−x0)·W, (y1−y0)·H)`. A search over screen sizes gives
  **W×H = 3440×1440** for this recording with total error **0.0002 px over
  five saccades** — an exact fit, not an approximation. (1920×1080 gives a
  ~1.4–1.6× mismatch, which is what an unaware reader would see first.)
- `SACCADE_DIR` = `atan2(−dy_px, dx_px)` in degrees, **0–360, measured
  counter-clockwise from +x with screen-up positive**.
- **Both definitions verified over all 14 saccades in the sample at
  3440×1440: max error 0.0002 px in magnitude and 0.00004° in direction.**
  These are the vendor's exact formulas, not an approximation.

**`_fixations.csv`** = group `all_gaze` rows by `FPOGID`, keep the last row
with `FPOGV=1`. Trivial once the per-sample file exists.

**`Data_Summary` AOI statistics** = Gazepoint-Analysis rectangles drawn on
media. We have no media and no AOIs; the analogue is the **per-trial target
hitbox**. Of its columns, we already have time-to-first-view
(`time_to_first_fixation_ms`), clicks (`is_hit`/`attempts`), fixations on
target (`fixations_per_trial` in `session_metrics.json`); "time viewed (s / %)"
and "revisits / revisitors" need on-target entry/exit tracking we do not
have. `MEDIA_*`/`VID_FRAME` are not applicable.

### 4.1 Do we already have code for any of Bucket D? — **No.** (Reported 2026-09-17.)

Checked `src/` and `analysis/` for any amplitude/direction/`hypot`/`atan2`,
per-fixation table, or revisit logic:

| D item | Existing code | Gap |
|---|---|---|
| `SACCADE_MAG`/`SACCADE_DIR` | None. `compute_fixation_saccade_metrics()` counts saccades from `fixation_id` transitions only; the Results page's "Mean amplitude / Mean direction" rows are hard-coded "—" (`results_page.py`) | Whole computation |
| Per-fixation table | None emitted. The grouping loop in `compute_fixation_saccade_metrics()` keeps only each fixation's final `FPOGD`; start time and POG are discarded | Emit a table instead of a scalar |
| AOI "time viewed" / "revisits" | None. `results_page.py` "Mean revisits" is hard-coded "—" | On-target entry/exit tracking — new instrumentation, not a derivation |
| **Prerequisite:** screen size in px | `GazepointClient` already queries `SCREEN_SIZE` at connect (used for `set_gaze_geometry`), but **`SessionMetadata` has no screen-size field** — nothing on disk says what W×H a session's normalized POG maps to | Persist `screen_width_px`/`screen_height_px` in `metadata.json` (additive) |

### 4.2 Which "screen size" — monitor, not canvas (decided 2026-09-17, user question)

The user asked whether the HUD-excluded canvas size (what hit-testing uses
during a task) is the right basis, on the intuition that it makes the gaze
cursor "more correct". **It is not, and the intuition is inverted.** From
`src/tasks/base_task.py` / `src/app.py::_tick`, two sizes are in use at the
same time for different jobs:

| Size | Set by (every frame) | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| Canvas (window minus the operator-panel column) | `set_screen_size(canvas.width(), canvas.height())` | Target positions and hitboxes — target coordinates are authored normalized-to-canvas |
| **Full tracked monitor** (`SCREEN_SIZE` from Gazepoint Control) + canvas on-screen offset | `set_gaze_geometry(...)` via `_sync_gaze_geometry()` | Converting the gaze pointer: `px = x·W_monitor − offset_x` |

The cursor is correct precisely *because* the pointer conversion uses the
monitor size, not the canvas: `FPOGX/BPOGX` are fractions of the calibrated
monitor and the tracker knows nothing about our window. Using the canvas
size there was the confirmed bug of `SPEC-gui-audit-2026-09-10.md` item 5.

**Rule for Bucket D (and for any downstream analysis of `gaze_stream.csv`
/ `all_gaze.csv`):**

1. Pixel saccade magnitude/direction = normalized Δ × **monitor** W×H.
   What we record is the raw device sample (`EyeInput.latest_sample()`,
   "used for recording, never for the pointer"), i.e. monitor-normalized.
2. The canvas must **never** be the scale factor. Because the panel is a
   *side* column, the canvas is narrower but not shorter than the monitor,
   so canvas scaling would shrink Δx by ~W_canvas/W_monitor (≈0.84 for a
   ~300 px column on 1920) and leave Δy alone — every direction rotated
   toward vertical and horizontal amplitudes under-read by ~16%. A
   systematic, anisotropic bias, not noise.
3. The canvas *offset* cancels out of any Δ, so it is irrelevant to
   `SACCADE_MAG`/`DIR`. Canvas size + offset are still worth persisting for
   position-relative analyses (on-target fixations, heatmaps over the task
   scene) — as a separate frame, never as the scale.
4. Monitor size is what Gazepoint Analysis uses (§4: the 3440×1440 fit is
   exact), so a methods section can cite "computed as in Gazepoint Analysis
   v7.3" truthfully.

**Persist at run start in `metadata.json`** (all additive; extends the §4.1
prerequisite):
- `screen_width_px`, `screen_height_px` — from `device_info.screen_width/
  height` (`SCREEN_SIZE`), the basis for every px-unit derivation;
- `canvas_width_px`, `canvas_height_px`, `canvas_offset_x_px`,
  `canvas_offset_y_px` — the frame targets live in;
- `screen_physical_width_mm`, `screen_physical_height_mm` — from config or
  `QScreen.physicalSize()` (validate: EDID values are sometimes wrong);
- `viewing_distance_mm` — config / a Setup-page field (Gazepoint's nominal
  operating distance is ~650 mm).

**Units for publication:** store amplitude in **px** (the vendor-comparable
quantity) and derive **degrees of visual angle** from the persisted physical
values — pixels are device-dependent (600 px on a 3440-px ultrawide is not
the eye movement 600 px on a 1920-px laptop is). Never store only degrees;
the px value plus the geometry is what makes a later re-analysis possible.
This resolves the second §8 question in favour of "both".

## 5. Plan — Bucket B + C: record the raw stream (decided)

**Decision (`AskUserQuestion`, 2026-09-17): a new per-sample file in the
exact Gazepoint Analysis column layout**, alongside the untouched
`gaze_stream.csv`. Rejected: widening `gaze_stream.csv` (mixes our
normalized names with Gazepoint's and stops being a drop-in for
Analysis-format tools); "both" was the same as the chosen option plus
duplication. Rationale for the chosen option: every existing reader and
test keeps working unchanged, and third-party tooling written for Gazepoint
exports (e.g. the `gp3tools` R package) reads our sessions directly.

### 5.1 File: `sessions/<run>/all_gaze.csv`

- Columns **in the sample's exact order and spelling** (§2), including the
  `TIME(<start>)` / `TIMETICK(f=…)` header forms so the file is
  byte-compatible with what Analysis produces.
- Columns whose source we deliberately don't have are still present and
  written as Analysis would for absent data: `MEDIA_ID`=0,
  `MEDIA_NAME`="" , biometrics (C′) as 0 / validity 0, `AOI`="" ,
  `VID_FRAME`=0. **`SACCADE_MAG`/`SACCADE_DIR` are written 0 until §6 is
  approved and wired**, then filled in the same file. Keeping the columns
  from day one means the header never changes shape later.
- `TIME` = seconds since **recording start** (recompute from the device
  `TIME` minus the first record's `TIME`), header stamped with the
  recorder's `open()` wall-clock time — matching Analysis, not the raw API
  origin. `TIMETICK` raw, with `TIME_TICK_FREQUENCY` queried once at
  connect for the header.
- One row per `<REC>` received, whether or not `valid` — Analysis writes
  every record.

### 5.2 Subscriptions and config

`configs/default.yaml` `gazepoint.enable.*` gains `counter`, `time_tick`,
`kb`, `user_data`, `pupil_left_px` / `pupil_right_px` (the pixel `LPD/RPD`
family — **distinct from** the existing `pupil_left`/`pupil_right` keys,
which are the mm `PUPILMM` switch; see the fix recorded in
[[peds-eye-gaze-assessment-pupilmm-fix-2026-08-31]] for why those names
must not be conflated), `blink`, `pix`. All default **on**; `enable_command`
mapping in `gazepoint_client.py` extended accordingly. Biometrics switches
(`DIAL`, `GSR`, `HR*`, `TTL`) are **not** added.

### 5.3 Where it plugs in

`GazepointClient`'s reader thread already parses every `<REC>` into an
attribute dict before `rec_to_sample()`; the raw dict is what
`all_gaze.csv` needs. Proposed: the client exposes the raw attrs alongside
the `GazeSample` (it already keeps a `_last_raw_pog` subset for the
dropout diagnostic), and `SessionRecorder` gains an `all_gaze` writer
opened next to `gaze_stream.csv`, gated by a new
`recording.save_all_gaze: true`. `gaze_stream.csv` and `rec_to_sample()`
are **not** changed — Bucket A stays as-is.

### 5.4 Tests (to write with the implementation)

- Header equality: our header == the sample file's header, column for
  column (one assertion against a checked-in copy of the 62-name list).
- A fake `<REC>` with every Bucket B/C attribute round-trips to the right
  column; a `<REC>` missing an attribute writes the Analysis-style default,
  never a blank shift.
- `TIME` origin: first row 0.0, monotone thereafter.
- `save_all_gaze: false` writes nothing and changes nothing else.
- The fake server (`tools/fake_gazepoint_server.py`) needs to emit the new
  attributes so the live path is exercisable without a subject.

## 6. Plan — Bucket D: derive, test, report, approve, then wire (gated)

**Stage 1 — derive + test, no app wiring.** A Qt-free module
(`src/data/saccades.py` or inside `exporter.py`) with:

- `fixation_table(rows, screen_w, screen_h)` → one record per fixation
  (last valid sample), carrying `FPOGID`, `FPOGS`, `FPOGD`, `FPOGX/Y`, and
  the derived `SACCADE_MAG`/`SACCADE_DIR` from the previous fixation.
- `saccade_mag_dir(prev_xy, cur_xy, screen_w, screen_h)` implementing §4
  exactly.

**The test that settles it:** run the derivation over the user's real
`User 0_all_gaze.csv` with W×H = 3440×1440 and assert the recomputed
`SACCADE_MAG`/`SACCADE_DIR` match the file's own columns on every fixation
row to within 0.01 px / 0.01°, and that the derived fixation rows are the
same `CNT`s as `User 0_fixations.csv`. That is a golden test against the
vendor's own output, not against our reading of the manual. (The sample
files are checked into the top-level `resources/`; the test needs a copy or
a fixture path under `tests/fixtures/`.)

**Stage 1 deliverable = a report to the user** with that test's result and
the session-level aggregates it enables (mean/median saccade amplitude in
px and, once screen physical size is known, in degrees of visual angle;
direction distribution). **Stop there.**

**Stage 2 — only after approval:** persist `screen_width_px`/`_height_px`
in `metadata.json` (§4.1 prerequisite); fill `SACCADE_MAG`/`SACCADE_DIR` in
`all_gaze.csv` at session close (they depend on the *next* fixation, so
they are a post-pass, exactly as Analysis does at export); write
`fixations.csv`; add `mean_saccade_amplitude_px` etc. to
`session_metrics.json`; replace the Results page's "—" for Mean amplitude /
Mean direction. AOI-style "time viewed / revisits" stay out of scope unless
separately requested — they need new on-target tracking (§4), not a
derivation.

## 7. Out of scope / not applicable

- Biometrics kit fields (C′) — user's decision; columns kept as zeros for
  layout parity only.
- `Data_Summary_export_*.csv` as a file — its AOI model has no counterpart
  here; the per-trial analogue already lives in `trials.csv` +
  `session_metrics.json`.
- Any change to `gaze_stream.csv`, `rec_to_sample()`, or the hit-testing
  path — §5.3 is purely additive.

## 8. Open questions

- §5.1: should `USER` carry our own event markers (e.g. `TARGET_SHOWN`,
  trial id) so `all_gaze.csv` is self-describing to an Analysis-format
  tool, or stay blank as the API sends it? Cheap either way; the former is
  more useful, the latter is stricter parity. Default if unasked: blank
  (strict parity), events stay in `events.jsonl`.
- ~~§6 Stage 2: report saccade amplitude in px only, or also in degrees of
  visual angle?~~ **Resolved in §4.2: both** — px stored, degrees derived
  from persisted physical size + viewing distance (to be added to
  `metadata.json` and the Setup page/config).

## 9. Implemented (2026-09-17, same day) — what was built and how it differs from §5/§6

Scope decided by `AskUserQuestion`: §5 + full §6 (approval gate waived),
§4.2 geometry persisted now with config-only physical size / viewing
distance (no Setup-page field), `USER` left blank (strict parity).

### 9.1 New module: `src/data/analysis_export.py` (Qt-free)

- `ALL_GAZE_COLUMNS` (the 62 names), `all_gaze_header()` (renders
  `TIME(<start>)` / `TIMETICK(f=…)`), `rec_to_all_gaze_row()` (device
  values verbatim; Analysis-style defaults for absent fields — `KB` is a
  single space, `USER`/`AOI` empty, floats `0.00000`, `TTL0` `0.000`).
- `read_all_gaze()` reads ours *or* a vendor file (drops the trailing empty
  column Analysis emits; keys rows by base column name).
- `fixation_row_indices()`, `saccade_mag_dir()`, `annotate_saccades()`,
  `finalize_all_gaze()` (the post-pass: rewrites `all_gaze.csv` with the
  saccade columns and writes `fixations.csv`).
- `compute_saccade_metrics()` (+ `saccade_amplitude_deg()`): n, mean/median
  amplitude px, circular-mean direction, mean amplitude in degrees **only
  when `metadata.json` carries the full geometry** — never guessed.

### 9.2 Three rules found while fitting `_fixations.csv` (beyond §4's two)

1. **The recording's final record is never a fixation row.** The sample's
   last fixation ends at `CNT=639` but its row is `CNT=638` — Analysis reads
   with one-record lookahead and never emits the last one. Reproduced.
2. **Zero-duration fixations are dropped** (`FPOGID=1` at `CNT=0`, `FPOGD=0`,
   absent from the vendor file).
3. **The trailing comma**: Analysis ends every line with an empty 63rd
   column. We write exactly 62 columns; §5.1's "byte-compatible" is
   therefore "column-compatible" — `read_all_gaze()` accepts both.

With these, the golden test matches the vendor's fixation rows **16/16 by
`CNT`** and `SACCADE_MAG`/`SACCADE_DIR` on every row within 0.01 px / 0.01°
(actual max error 0.0002 px / 0.00004°).

### 9.3 Departures from the §5/§6 text

- **`MEDIA_NAME` = the task id**, not "" — the task *is* our stimulus, and
  a self-describing file costs nothing. `MEDIA_ID` stays 0.
- **Rows are captured at device rate, not per GUI frame.** `latest()` gives
  one sample per tick (~75 Hz here, so a 150 Hz stream would lose half its
  records); the client now keeps a `deque` of every parsed `<REC>` and
  `drain_raw()` hands them to `SessionRecorder.record_raw()` each tick. The
  live check below: 860 `all_gaze` rows vs. 3 976 `gaze_stream` rows for the
  same 52 s run — the fake server streams at 20 Hz while the GUI ticked at
  ~76 Hz, so the two files legitimately differ in row count in *either*
  direction depending on which side is faster. `gaze_stream.csv` is
  untouched.
- **`TIME` origin** = the first record drained *for this run* (the reader
  thread only starts at run start, after calibration — so no pre-run
  records leak in). Device `TIME` when present, else host time; never
  mixed.
- **Replay mode** queues a raw record once per distinct fixture record
  (`ReplayGazeSource.sample_and_record_at()`), only for raw-REC fixtures.
- **Saccade scale fallback:** if `SCREEN_SIZE` was never reported, the
  post-pass scales by `app.screen_width_px/height_px` and writes a
  `session.log` line saying so — the file still gets values, but the log
  says they are not device-sourced.
- **Physical size** comes from `QScreen.physicalSize()` (EDID) unless
  `app.screen_physical_width_mm/height_mm` is set; this machine reported
  527×296 mm, plausible for its 24" panel.

### 9.4 Files changed

`src/data/analysis_export.py` (new), `src/data/recorder.py`
(`open_all_gaze`, `record_raw`), `src/data/schema.py` (9 geometry fields),
`src/data/exporter.py` (`saccades` block in `session_metrics.json`),
`src/inputs/gazepoint_client.py` (8 enable keys, `TIME_TICK_FREQUENCY`
query → `DeviceInfo.tick_frequency`, raw queue + `drain_raw()`),
`src/app.py` (open/drain/finalize + `_record_geometry()`),
`src/ui/results_page.py` (Mean amplitude / Mean direction filled),
`configs/default.yaml` (new `enable.*` keys, `recording.save_all_gaze`,
`app.screen_physical_*_mm`, `app.viewing_distance_mm`),
`tools/fake_gazepoint_server.py` (emits every recorded attribute +
`TIME_TICK_FREQUENCY`), `tests/test_analysis_export.py` (new, 16 tests),
`tests/fixtures/gazepoint_analysis_sample/` (the vendor export, checked in
as the golden fixture — an anonymous "User 0" test recording, not subject
data), `tests/test_gazepoint_client.py` (+3), `docs/DATA_SCHEMA.md`.

**Suite: 219 collected, 218 passed, 1 pre-existing unrelated failure**
(`target_fps` drift), +19.

### 9.5 Live validation (qt-mcp, fake server on 4250, subject `PARITYTEST`)

| Check | Observed |
|---|---|
| Subscriptions sent at connect | all 13 expected `ENABLE_SEND_*` (incl. COUNTER, TIME_TICK, KB, USER_DATA, PUPIL_LEFT/RIGHT, BLINK, PIX); none of DIAL/GSR/HR/TTL; `TIME_TICK_FREQUENCY` queried and answered |
| `all_gaze.csv` | header exactly the 62 columns with `TIME(2026/09/17 09:00:39.228)` / `TIMETICK(f=1000000000)`; 860 rows; `TIME` starts at `0.00000`; `MEDIA_NAME=click_static`; `KB=" "`, `USER=""`, biometrics 0 |
| `fixations.csv` | 30 rows, one per `FPOGID`, each the last row before the id changed; first row `SACCADE_MAG=0` |
| Derived values | waypoint (0.50,0.15)→(0.85,0.15): **672.00 px, 0.00°** = 0.35×1920 exactly; (0.85,0.15)→(0.15,0.50): 195.71° (dx −1344, dy +378) |
| `metadata.json` | `screen 1920×1080`, `canvas 1640×957 at +0,+75` (the operator column is on the right, the title bar above), `physical 527×296 mm`, `viewing_distance 650` |
| `session_metrics.json` `saccades` | `n 29, mean 936.8 px, median 672.0 px, mean 22.24°, direction 357.48°` |
| Results page | "Mean amplitude **936.8 px (22.24°)**", "Mean direction **357.5°**" — previously "—" |

**Cleanup:** `PARITYTEST` session/calibration/settings deleted, dashboard +
fake server killed (the fake server needed a by-port kill — the command-line
match missed it), ports 4250/9142 confirmed closed, `local_state.json`
restored 4250 → `127.0.0.1:4242`.

### 9.6 Not exercised / caveats

- Real GP3 HD not tested this round (no subject); the fake server proves
  the plumbing, and the golden test proves the maths against the vendor.
  A real 150 Hz run should show `all_gaze.csv` with ~2× the rows of
  `gaze_stream.csv`.
- `configs/default.yaml` has `git update-index --skip-worktree` set; the
  committed copy is staged separately from the local drift (see the log).
- The headless `--replay` path (`task_runner.run_headless_replay`) does
  not write `all_gaze.csv` — it has no client to drain. Unchanged.

## 10. Log

- **2026-09-17 — §1–§4 findings + §5–§6 plan written, via
  `/sparc:orchestrator`; design only, zero `src`/`tests` changes.** The
  sample export was analysed programmatically (fixation-row rule, 62-column
  list, `SACCADE_MAG`/`DIR` definition and the 3440×1440 screen fit). §4.1
  answered the user's "do we already have the code for D?" — no, for every
  item, plus the unrecorded-screen-size prerequisite. File-layout fork
  decided by `AskUserQuestion` (new Analysis-format `all_gaze.csv`).
  `docs/CLINICAL_DATA_REFERENCE.md`'s "planned next step" paragraph replaced
  with a pointer here; `docs/DATA_SCHEMA.md` given a one-line pointer to the
  planned file. Committed as `9207e24` (verified 2026-09-30, see §10).

- **2026-09-17, later — §4.2 added: monitor size, not canvas size, is the
  basis for pixel saccade metrics.** Answers the user's two follow-up
  questions (does the HUD-excluded canvas make the cursor "more correct"?
  — no, the pointer conversion deliberately uses the monitor size; which
  size for downstream/paper analysis? — monitor, canvas scaling would bias
  amplitude ~16% and rotate direction). Extends the §4.1 prerequisite to
  persist monitor px, canvas px + offset, physical mm, and viewing distance
  in `metadata.json`; resolves the §8 px-vs-degrees question as "both".
  Still design only.

- **2026-09-17, later still — §9: IMPLEMENTED (§5 + full §6 + §4.2
  geometry), tested, live-validated, via `/sparc:orchestrator`.** Scope,
  geometry-entry method and the `USER` column decided by `AskUserQuestion`
  (full §6 with the approval gate waived; config-only physical size /
  viewing distance; `USER` blank). New Qt-free `src/data/analysis_export.py`
  with a golden test against the vendor's own export (16/16 fixation rows
  by `CNT`; `SACCADE_MAG`/`DIR` to 0.0002 px / 0.00004°) — three further
  vendor rules found while fitting (§9.2). Raw records captured at device
  rate via a client-side queue, not per GUI frame (§9.3). Live run against
  the fake server: every subscription sent, `all_gaze.csv` + `fixations.csv`
  + geometry in `metadata.json` + `saccades` in `session_metrics.json`, and
  the Results page's Mean amplitude / Mean direction filled (§9.5). Suite
  219 / 218 / 1 pre-existing. `docs/DATA_SCHEMA.md` documents the new files
  and fields. Committed as `4387319`, included in the `v1.0.0` tag
  (verified 2026-09-30, see §10).

- **2026-09-30 — corrected stale "uncommitted" claims.** §1 and the two log
  entries above had said this work was still uncommitted; `git log` shows
  both commits landed on 2026-09-17: `9207e24` (design-only, the first
  entry above) and `4387319` (§9's implementation, folded into the
  `v1.0.0` tag alongside `dbcd011`). No code or behaviour change, doc-only
  correction.
