# Gazepoint GP3 HD Onboarding Corpus

Knowledge corpus for onboarding the **Gazepoint GP3 HD eye tracker (150 Hz)**, built from the
ten vendor PDFs in `resources/gazepoints/documents/`.

The corpus has two layers:

- **`sources/`** — one file per source PDF, verbatim. Full fidelity, traceable to the original.
  Use these when you need the exact vendor wording.
- **`synthesis/`** — derived topic files that pull scattered facts together for onboarding.
  Nothing here is new information; every claim traces to a file in `sources/`.

## Synthesis (start here)

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| [synthesis/gp3-hd-specifications.md](synthesis/gp3-hd-specifications.md) | GP3 HD specs, how they differ from the 60 Hz GP3, biometrics module specs, host requirements |
| [synthesis/setup-and-calibration.md](synthesis/setup-and-calibration.md) | End-to-end runbook: unbox → mount → position → install → calibrate |
| [synthesis/api-reference.md](synthesis/api-reference.md) | Open Gaze API protocol and the complete configuration-command table |
| [synthesis/data-fields-reference.md](synthesis/data-fields-reference.md) | Every data field, cross-referenced between the API `<REC>` stream and the Analysis CSV export |
| [synthesis/troubleshooting.md](synthesis/troubleshooting.md) | All troubleshooting guidance consolidated, by symptom |

## The product family, in one paragraph

**GP3** and **GP3 HD** are the desktop eye trackers; the HD samples at 150 Hz over USB 3.0, the
standard GP3 at 60 Hz over USB 2.0. **GP3-Mobile** is a separate stand-mounted rig for phone/tablet
studies. **Gazepoint Control** is the capture application and API server — it must be running for
anything else to receive data. **Gazepoint Analysis** is the recording and analysis application
(Standard / Professional / UX editions). **Gazepoint Biometrics** is an optional hardware module
adding GSR/EDA, heart rate, a self-report dial, and TTL I/O. **Remote Viewer** is an add-on that
streams the Analysis display to observers on another machine.

## Provenance and caveats

- All ten PDFs were parsed with NetMind's `parse_pro` engine, which recovered the specification
  tables and figure captions with correct row/column structure.
- **Identifier corrections.** NetMind reliably mangles underscores in code identifiers — it read
  `TIME_TICK` as `TIME tick`, `VALID_POINTS` as `VALIDPOINTS`, `CALIBRATE_SHOW` as `CALIBRATEShow`,
  `AOI_EXPORT` as `AOIXPORT`, and `NSURLSession WebSocket` as `NSIROLSession WSocket`. Because exact
  identifier spelling is the entire value of an API corpus, every affected token was cross-checked
  against an independent `pdftotext` extraction and corrected — **39 occurrences across three files** in the first
  pass, concentrated in the API manual, plus **9 more occurrences in the API manual**
  (`CALIBRATE_show`, `TIME_TICK frequency`, `ENABLE_SEND_POG BEST`, `VALID Points`) and a corrupted
  OpenCV URL in two files, found on 2026-10-06. The first pass compared identifier *sets*, which
  cannot see a mangled occurrence when the correct spelling also appears elsewhere in the same file;
  an occurrence-level check can. Each correction is itemised in that file's `parser_corrections`
  frontmatter, so the edits are auditable rather than silent. A verification pass now confirms that
  every `SCREAMING_SNAKE` identifier in the PDF text layer is present in the corpus with no mangled
  variant left, and that every link is backed by the PDFs' text or link annotations. This is the one
  deliberate respect in which `sources/` is not byte-verbatim; one unrecorded non-identifier
  deviation is known: the parser turned the vendor's "they are compensate for head movement" into
  "compensated" in `gazepoint-analysis.md`.
- **Figures are not extracted.** Each image is marked `[FIGURE]` with its original caption retained
  where the document had one. Several procedures (mount assembly, Control UI) reference figures
  that are not reproduced here — consult the source PDF when a step is visual.
- Page headers, footers, and copyright lines were dropped by the parser as page furniture.
- Revision dates are the vendor's own "Revised …" line. Note the spread: Remote Viewer's manual
  dates from 2020 and Biometrics from 2023, so those are likelier to lag the shipping software
  than Control, Analysis, or the API doc.
- **One unresolved conflict between sources** regarding USB hubs — see
  [synthesis/setup-and-calibration.md](synthesis/setup-and-calibration.md#usb-connection-conflict).
